But the theory of perspective that changed the course of Western art originated elsewhere-it was formulated in Baghdad by the eleventh-century mathematician Ibn al Haithan, known in the West as Alhazen. Using the metaphor of the mutual gaze, or exchanged glances, Hans Belting-preeminent historian and theorist of medieval, Renaissance, and contemporary art-narrates the historical encounter between science and art, between Arab Baghdad and Renaissance Florence, that has had a lasting effect on the culture of the West.</p><p><br></p><p><br>In this lavishly illustrated study, Belting deals with the double history of perspective, as a visual theory based on geometrical abstraction (in the Middle East) and as pictorial theory (in Europe). How could geometrical abstraction be reconceived as a theory for making pictures? During the Middle Ages, Arab mathematics, free from religious discourse, gave rise to a theory of perspective that, later in the West, was transformed into art when European painters adopted the human gaze as their focal point. In the Islamic world, where theology and the visual arts remained closely intertwined, the science of perspective did not become the cornerstone of Islamic art. <i>Florence and Baghdad</i> addresses a provocative question that reaches beyond the realm of aesthetics and mathematics: What happens when Muslims and Christians look upon each other and find their way of viewing the world transformed as a result?</p></p><p>Hans Belting is Professor for Art History and Media Theory at the Academy for Design in Karlsruhe, Germany.<i>Florence and Baghdad</i> is a refreshing appeal to view the genesis of the unconscious visual foundations in both cultures in all their historical complexity and to illuminate their interdependence. (<i>Die Tageszeitung</i>)<br><br>You will find no better guide through this thicket of philosophy, optics, crafts and theology in East and West than Belting &#x2013; and certainly no one else could make it so clear that these are not just old problems we can gladly leave to historians... If we look carefully we can still discover that most of what we thought we knew was wrong. Belting gives us a fresh new eye for art and the world. (<i>Frankfurter Rundschau</i>)<br><br>The connection Belting establishes between long-known facts in the history of science and the origins of the "window view" is a stroke of genius. (<i>Sï¿½ddeutsche Zeitung</i>)<br><br>This book is an eye-opener for readers who will come to understand the limitations and drawbacks of the kinds of images that are omnipresent in our society in the form of films and photographs. (<i>Art: Das Kunstmagazin</i>)<br><br>Belting has expanded our field of vision to include both the history of art and of science, in both Islam and the West, and by so doing has given research on central perspective an entirely new foundation. (Friederike Reents <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i> 2008-05-23)<br><br>Belting easily balances the contributions of two diverse cultures--European art and Arabic science--in a deeply scholarly yet captivating manner. He presents the well-documented historical connection between a mathematic theory sprung from 11th-century Baghdad and its influence on the use of perspective in Renaissance-era European artists...The timely translation is excellent as ideas flow logically, past to present. (Marianne Laino Sade <i>Library Journal</i> 2011-10-01)<br><br>In <i>Florence and Baghdad: Renaissance Art and Arab Science</i>, Belting makes a compelling case that the vision of the Renaissance--a vision that still holds us today--began not in Florence, but in Baghdad, with important implications for both cultures...Reproducing the complexity of Belting's argument here seems like "playing God," too, in capturing the majesty of his examples and endless connections (all wonderfully translated from the original German by Deborah Lucas Schneider). The combination of illustrations and verbal explanations on the nature of Islamic aniconism surpasses any previous discussion I've read, making the sometimes daunting trek through the forest of soaring ideas well worth the trip once you've reached the clearing of Belting's payoff. The real strength of <i>Florence and Baghdad</i> is how Belting puts those two worlds on equal footing--side by side in coming to grips with the same idea in a way determined by their culture. In first warning himself of the dangers of Eurocentrism and colonialism whenever you talk of "influence," Belting warns us of similar mistakes. "Linear perspective is not universal but rather tied to a particular culture," Belting concludes, allowing for the difference of Arabic versus Christian art while also providing discursive space to analyze how and why they differ, and what that difference may mean to us...From Africa to Asia to the Middle East, the Western way of seeing in perspective--individualized, human-centered perspective--eliminated all other ways of seeing and, along with them, ways of cultural being. Hans Belting's <i>Florence and Baghdad: Renaissance Art and Arab Science</i> strikes the first blow for reversing the tide of that visual encroachment, or at the very least of recognizing the cultural blindness of imposed ways of seeing and how that blindness continues to keep the Middle East and West from seeing eye to eye. (Bob Duggan <i>BigThink.com</i> 2011-10-20)<br><br>It is hard to do justice to the brilliance and complexity of this book, which provides no less than a complete re-evaluation of the origins of perspective in Western art. Hans Belting, an internationally recognized authority on the theory of art from Hieronymus Bosch to Marcel Duchamp, argues that the scientific and artistic genesis of linear perspective did not come out of the Florence of Giotto and Brunelleschi as we are usually told by art historians, but instead first emerged in eleventh-century Baghdad in the work of lbn a1-Haytham (965-1040), a mathematician born in Basra who became known in the West as Alhazen, "the Arab Archimedes"...<i>Florence and Baghdad</i> is a remarkable and brave book which takes on a highly contentious area of East-West artistic, scientific and political exchange...It reads like a cross-cultural <i>Ways of Seeing</i>: it is about art and science, painting and mathematics, politics and religion, hermeneutics and phenomenology. Ultimately it is the book of a very fine scholar learning to think across cultures and resist simplistic separations at a time when this is most needed. (Jerry Brotton <i>Literary Review</i> 2011-11-01)<br><br><i>Florence and Baghdad</i> is...in large part a meditation on the nature of symbolic forms and consequently an interrogation of the neo-Kantian ideas of Ernst Cassirer and Ernst Panofsky...Belting...convincingly shows how the Arab geometrical approach was taken up in the West and transformed into a way of portraying spatial depth. Moreover, unlike Panofsky, his contrasting of Western and Islamic art leads to an exploration of the different ways in which the two cultures conceive the "gaze."...<i>Florence and Baghdad</i> is beautifully illustrated...This frankly difficult book provides challenging exercises for the mind. (Robert Irwin <i>The Art Newspaper</i> 2011-11-01)<br><br>It is at first appropriate to admire Belting's book as a beautiful object. It contains a number of fine photos and illustrations, and it is a pleasure to just browse through it...Belting aspires to be one of the cultural milestones that change our essential views on art and visual culture. <i>Florence and Baghdad</i> is not just a well-written academic study, it is also a book accessible to a wide audience. Occasionally it even reads like a thriller. The best thing is, once you finish it, you realize it isn't just amusing, but eye-opening.

When read along with its rigorous textual notes, the book also becomes the richest scholarly treatment of Deleuze's entire philosophical oeuvre available in any language. Finally, the dozens of explicit examples that Brian Massumi furnishes from contemporary artistic, scientific, and popular urban culture make the book an important, perhaps even central text within current debates on postmodern culture and politics.Capitalism and Schizophrenia is the general title for two books published a decade apart. The first, Anti-Oedipus, was a reaction to the events of May/June 1968; it is a critique of "state-happy" Marxism and "school-building" strains of psychoanalysis. The second, A Thousand Plateaus, is an attempt at a positive statement of the sort of nomad philosophy Deleuze and Guattari propose as an alternative to state philosophy.</p></p><p>A user&#39;s guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia is a playful and emphatically practical elaboration of the major collaborative work of the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari.Brian Massumi is Professor in the Department of Communication Sciences at the University of Montrï¿½al.

Following the development of scientific ideas about these dramatic events, Macdougall traces the lives of many of the brilliant and intriguing characters who have contributed to the evolving understanding of how ice ages come about. As it explains how the great Pleistocene Ice Age has shaped the earth's landscape and influenced the course of human evolution, <i>Frozen Earth </i>also provides a fascinating look at how science is done, how the excitement of discovery drives scientists to explore and investigate, and how timing and chance play a part in the acceptance of new scientific ideas.<br><br>Macdougall describes the awesome power of cataclysmic floods that marked the melting of the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age. He probes the chilling evidence for "Snowball Earth," an episode far back in the earth's past that may have seen our planet encased in ice from pole to pole. He discusses the accumulating evidence from deep-sea sediment cores, as well as ice cores from Greenland and the Antarctic, that suggests fast-changing ice age climates may have directly impacted the evolution of our species and the course of human migration and civilization. <i>Frozen Earth </i>also chronicles how the concept of the ice age has gripped the imagination of scientists for almost two centuries. It offers an absorbing consideration of how current studies of Pleistocene climate may help us understand earth's future climate changes, including the question of when the next glacial interval will occur.</p><p>"This is a highly readable account of the nature of ice ages throughout earth's history and the evolution of their scientific understanding since the introduction of the term by Louis Agassiz in the 1830s.

From &#34;The Adventure of the Gloria Scott&#34; to &#34;His Last Bow&#34;, we follow the illustrious career of this quintessential British hero from his university days to his final case. His efforts to uncover the truth take him all over the world and into conflict with all manner of devious criminals and dangerous villains, but thankfully his legendary powers of deduction, and his faithful companion Dr. Watson, are more than up to the challenge.</p><p>This volume, authorized by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's estate, contains all 4 full-length novels and all 56 short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes. At over a thousand pages, the weighty tome is a perfect gift for budding amateur sleuths, and it is an ideal companion for a long stay on a desert island (or a leisurely trip through the English countryside). As the reader wades past the tense introductions of <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and moves towards such classic tales as <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, "The Adventure of the Speckled Band," and "The Final Problem," she is sure to draw her own conclusions about Holmes's veiled past and his quirky relationship with his "Boswell," Watson. Doyle never revealed much about Holmes's early life, but the joy of reading the complete Holmes is assembling the trivia of each story into something like a portrait of the detective and his creator. By the end of the long journey through London and across Europe (with a long stopover at Reichenbach Falls), one is apt to have found a friend for life. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i>Here, collected in one volume, are all four full-length novels and 56 short stories chronicling the colorful adventures of Sherlock Holmes--every word Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Baker Street&#39;s most famous resident.</p><h2>The Father Connection: How You Can Make the Difference in Your Child&#39;s Self-Esteem and Sense of Purpose</h2><p>&#x201c;As a young father I was running scared . . .

He and his wife Dorothy have four grown children and live in Dallas, Texas.</p><h2>Complete Shorter Fiction (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Herman Melville (1819-91) brought as much genius to the smaller-scale literary forms as he did to the full-blown novel: his poems and the short stories and novellas collected in this volume reveal a deftness and a delicacy of touch that is in some ways even more impressive than the massive, tectonic passions of <i>Moby-Dick</i>. In a story like "Bartleby, the Scrivener" -- one of the very few perfect representatives of the form in the English language -- he displayed an unflinching precision and insight and empathy in his depiction of the drastically alienated inner life of the title character. In "Benito Cereno," he addressed the great racial dilemmas of the nineteenth century with a profound, almost surreal imaginative clarity. And in Billy, Budd, Sailor, the masterpiece of his last years, he fused the knowledge and craft gained from a lifetime's magnificent work into a pure, stark, flawlessly composed tale of innocence betrayed and destroyed. Melville is justly honored for the epic sweep of his mind, but his lyricism, his skill in rendering the minute, the particular, the local, was equally sublime.</p></p><p>&#34;We are, perhaps, after a century of literary wastelands, able to read not only a personal predicament but a general truth in Melville&#39;s blasted islands, bedevilled slave ships, misshapen houses, falling towers, ticking tables, ghastly factories, sickly cottages, and blank brick city walls. The appetite for truth is what gives Melville&#39;s narratives their persistent interest and, even under the spell of discouragement, their untoward verbal energy ... Like Billy Budd, Melville when a sailor on a man-of-war was a top-man, at home on the highest yards, enjoying the widest view ... Melville instinctively aspired to the grandest scale, and even in his shorter works offers vast inklings and the resonance of cosmic concerns.Herman Melville was born in New York City in 1819. When his father died, he was forced to leave school and find work. After passing through some minor clerical jobs, the eighteen-year-old young man shipped out to sea, first on a short cargo trip, then, at twenty-one, on a three-year South Sea whaling venture. From the experiences accumulated on this voyage would come the material for his early books,&nbsp;<i>Typee</i>&nbsp;(1846) and&nbsp;<i>Omoo</i>&nbsp;(1847), as well as for such masterpieces as&nbsp;<i>Moby-Dick</i>&nbsp;(1851),&nbsp;<i>Pierre</i>&nbsp;(1852),&nbsp;<i>The Piazza Tales&nbsp;</i>(1856) and&nbsp;<i>Billy Budd, Sailor, and Other Stories</i>&nbsp;(posthumous, 1924).<br><br>Though the first two novels&#x2014;popular romantic adventures&#x2014;sold well, Melville's more serious writing failed to attract a large audience, perhaps because it attacked the current philosophy of transcendentalism and its espoused "self-reliance." (As he made clear in the savagely comic&nbsp;<i>The Confidence Man</i>&nbsp;(1857), Melville thought very little of Emersonian philosophy. He spent his later years working as a customs inspector on the New York docks, writing only poems comprising&nbsp;<i>Battle-Pieces</i>&nbsp;(1866). He died in 1891, leaving&nbsp;<i>Billy Budd, Sailor, and Other Stories</i>&nbsp;unpublished.</p><h2>The Secret Agent (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p>Inspired by an attempt in 1894 to blow up London&#x2019;s Greenwich Observatory, <i>The Secret Agent</i>&nbsp;is the unsurpassed original of the long tradition of espionage thrillers that explore the confused motives at the heart of terrorism. Published in 1907, Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s novel was remarkably prescient, anticipating the political contours of the next century, as well as the classic spy novels of such later writers as Graham Greene and John Le Carrï¿½. <br><br>Conrad&#x2019;s double agent, Verloc, is a Russian spy tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group in London. His mission to discredit the ineffectual radicals and their cause goes awry, and involves his unsuspecting wife and her vulnerable younger brother in disastrous ways. In its use of powerful psychological insight to intensify narrative suspense, <i>The Secret Agent </i>broke new literary ground. Conrad was the first novelist to discover the strange, in-between territory of the political exile, and his genius was such that we still have no truer map of that region&#x2019;s moral terrain than his story of a terrorist plot and its tragic consequences for both the guilty and the innocent.<br><br>Introduction by Paul Theroux<br><br>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed).</p><p>The Secret Agent (1907) is a compelling tale of espionage and terrorism set in Edwardian London.

In <i>The Creation of Inequality,</i> Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus demonstrate that this development was not simply the result of population increase, food surplus, or the accumulation of valuables. Instead, inequality resulted from conscious manipulation of the unique social logic that lies at the core of every human group. </p><p>A few societies allowed talented and ambitious individuals to rise in prestige while still preventing them from becoming a hereditary elite. But many others made high rank hereditary, by manipulating debts, genealogies, and sacred lore. At certain moments in history, intense competition among leaders of high rank gave rise to despotic kingdoms and empires in the Near East, Egypt, Africa, Mexico, Peru, and the Pacific. </p><p>Drawing on their vast knowledge of both living and prehistoric social groups, Flannery and Marcus describe the changes in logic that create larger and more hierarchical societies, and they argue persuasively that many kinds of inequality can be overcome by reversing these changes, rather than by violence.</p></p><p><p>Kent Flannery is James B.

It documents Rothko's entire output of paintings on canvas and panel, reproducing all the extant works in color. An introductory text also investigates every essential feature of Rothko's art. <p> David Anfam explores the underestimated variety as well as the amazing continuity of Rothko's pictures. These include the images for which Rothko is famous--the large, hypnotic, and poignant fields of color--along with almost 400 further pictures that reveal a far less well known yet fascinating figure who was attuned by turns to realism, expressionism, surrealism, and the avant-garde issues of his era. </p><p> Anfam presents a radical overview of Rothko's achievement, drawing upon unpublished material and interviews. Special attention is given to Rothko's sources and themes: they extend from a study of such old masters as Rembrandt and Vermeer to his eventual groundbreaking vision of painting as an environment, expressed in the mural cycles and the architectonic ensemble of the Rothko Chapel in Houston. The author analyzes the physical makeup of the paintings, as well as Rothko's innovative sense of space, color, and surface, his complex technical procedures, and the symbolism and philosophical basis of the work. This is combined with an account of Rothko's stylistic evolution and its chronology. Rothko's progress is traced from figuration to an abstract vision imbued with a profound grasp of how the viewer has an interactive role to play in perceiving the works. The volume also includes the most extensive Rothko bibliography ever published. The result of nearly a decade of research sponsored by the National Gallery of Art, this monumental publication is the reference point for all future studies of Rothko's art.</p><b>David Anfam</b> is a leading authority on modern American art.

It contains a year by year chronology of events in his own life, that of his forbears and of his books since. A more extended biographical section runs to a hundred pages. This is followed by a detailed portrait of each of his many books, with background, summary, contemporary critical reactions and publication history. Next there is a &#39;Who&#39;s who&#39; of characters in Lewis&#39; life, including his academic &#39;club&#39;, The Inklings. Similar in style is the &#39;What&#39;s what&#39; section, featuring among other things the colleges in which he worked and his homes.

All are governed by the laws of symmetry, which elegantly unify scientific and artistic principles. Yet the mathematical language of symmetry-known as group theory-did not emerge from the study of symmetry at all, but from an equation that couldn't be solved. <br> <br> For thousands of years mathematicians solved progressively more difficult algebraic equations, until they encountered the quintic equation, which resisted solution for three centuries. Working independently, two great prodigies ultimately proved that the quintic cannot be solved by a simple formula. These geniuses, a Norwegian named Niels Henrik Abel and a romantic Frenchman named ï¿½variste Galois, both died tragically young. Their incredible labor, however, produced the origins of group theory. <br> <br> The first extensive, popular account of the mathematics of symmetry and order, <i>The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved</i> is told not through abstract formulas but in a beautifully written and dramatic account of the lives and work of some of the greatest and most intriguing mathematicians in history.</p><p>"Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how the apparently remote concerns of pure mathematics can lead too deep and practical insights into the natural world." --Ian Stewart, author of DOES GOD PLAY DICE? <p>"A highly readable and illuminating book." --Sir Michael Atiyah, Abel Prize in Mathematics Laureate 2004</p>Mario Livio is an internationally known astrophysicist, a bestselling author, and a popular speaker who has appeared on&nbsp;<i>The Daily Show</i>,&nbsp;<i>60 Minutes</i>, and&nbsp;<i>NOVA</i>.

Its basic text seems to have been prepared before 1,000 B.C., in the last days of the Shang Dynasty and the first part of the Chou Dynasty. It was one of the Five Classics edited by Confucius, who is reported to have wished he had fifty more years of life to study it. Since the time of Confucius it has never lost its enormous significance; it has been used by Confucianists and Taoists alike, by learned literary scholars and street shamans, by the official state cult and by private individuals.<br>Basically, the I Ching is a manual of divination, founded upon what modern scholars like Wolfgang Pauli, the Nobel Laureate physicist and C. G. Jung, the psychoanalyst, have called the synchronistic concept of the universe. This means that all things happening at a certain time have certain characteristic features which can be isolated, so that in addition to vertical causality, one may also have horizontal linkages. According to tradition, King Wan and his son the Duke of Chou spent their lives analyzing the results of divination in terms of interacting polar forces and six-variable hexagrams, correlating an observed body of events with predictions. Whether this account is true or not, the I Ching still retains its primacy in Chinese thought.<br>Apart from its enormous value in Oriental studies, the I Ching is very important in the history of religions, history of philosophy, and even in certain aspects of modern Western thought. It is one of the very few divination manuals that have survived into modern times, and it is typologically interesting as perhaps the most developed, most elaborate system that is known in detail. In philosophy, it marks a stage in the development of human thought, while the I Ching has recently become very important in the understanding of certain cultural developments in the Western world.<br>This present work is the standard English translation by the great Sinologist James Legge, prepared for the Sacred Books of the East series. It contains the basic text attributed to King Wan and the Duke of Chou, the ten appendices usually attributed to Confucius, a profound introduction by Legge, and exhaustive footnotes explaining the text for a Western reader.</p><p></p><h2>Acts of Meaning: Four Lectures on Mind and Culture (The Jerusalem-Harvard Lectures)</h2><p>Jerome Bruner argues that the cognitive revolution, with its current fixation on mind as &#x201c;information processor,&#x201d; has led psychology away from the deeper objective of understanding mind as a creator of meanings.

Yawning, that was a good sign. Getting oxygen. He was trying to get amped up. Breaking in overnight had left them with plenty of downtime to sit and eat their sandwiches and goof on each other and get comfortable, and that wasn't good for the job. Doug had lost his buzz -- the action, fear, and momentum that was the cocktail of banditry. Get in, get the money, get out. His father talking, but fuck it, on this subject the old crook was right. Doug was ready for this thing to fall.<br><br>He swung his head side to side but could not crack his neck. He looked at the black .38 in his hand, but gripping a loaded pistol had long since lost its porn. He wasn't there for thrills. He wasn't even there for money, though he wouldn't leave without it. He was there for the job. The job of the job, like the thing of the thing. Him and Jem and Dez and Gloansy pulling pranks together, same as when they were kids -- only now it was their livelihood. Heisting was what they did and who they were.<br><br>His blood warmed to that, the broad muscles of his back tingling. He rapped the hard plastic forehead of his goalie mask with his pistol barrel and shook out the cobwebs as he turned toward the door. A pro, an athlete at the top of his game. He was at the height of his powers.<br><br>Jem stood across from him like a mirror image: the dusty navy blue jumpsuit zipped over the armored vest, the gun in his gloved hand, and the white goalie mask marked up with black stitch scars, his eyes two dark sockets.<br><br>Happy voices approaching, muffled. Keys turning in reinforced locks, strongbars releasing.<br><br>A spear of daylight. A woman's hand on the knob and the kick of a chunky black shoe -- and the swish of a black floral skirt walking into Doug's life.<br><br>He seized the branch manager's arm and spun her around in front of him, showing her the pistol without jamming it in her face. Her eyes were green and bright and full, but it was his mask that scared short her scream, not the Colt.<br><br>Jem kicked the door shut behind the assistant manager, smacking the cardboard caddy out of the guy's hand. Two steaming cups of coffee splattered against the wall, leaving a runny brown stain.<br><br>Doug took the bank keys from the manager's hand and felt her going weak. He walked her down the short hallway to the tellers' row behind the front counter, where Gloansy -- identically dressed, masked, and Kevlar-bulked -- waited. The bank manager startled at the sight of him, but she had no breath left for screaming. Doug passed her off to Gloansy, who laid her and the gray-suited assistant manager face-first on the carpeting behind the cages. Gloansy started yanking off their shoes, his voice deepened and filtered by the mask.<br><br>Lie still. Shut your eyes. Nobody gets hurt.<br><br>Doug moved with Jem through the open security door into the lobby. Dez stood beside the front door, hidden from Kenmore Square by the drawn blinds. He checked the window before flashing a blue-gloved thumb, and Doug and Jem crossed the only portion of the lobby visible from the ATM vestibule.<br><br>Jem unfolded a deep canvas hockey bag on the floor. Doug turned the stubbiest key on the manager's ring in the night-deposit cabinet lock, and silver plastic deposit bags spilled to the floor like salmon from a cut net. A holiday weekend's worth. Doug gathered them up five and six at a time, soft bags of cash and checks bundled in deposit slips, dumping the catch into Jem's open duffel.<br><br>After raiding the night drop, Doug went on alone to the access door behind the ATM. He matched key to lock, then looked over to the tellers' cages where Jem had the branch manager on her feet. She looked small without shoes, head down, hair slipping over her face.<br><br>"Again," Jem commanded her. "Louder."<br><br>She said, staring at the floor, "Four. Five. Seven. Eight."<br><br>Doug ignored the choke in her voice and punched the code into the mechanical dial over the key. The door swung open on the ATM closet, and Doug unlatched the feeder and pulled the cash cassette. After the long weekend it was less than half full. He scooped out the sheets of postage stamps as an afterthought and dumped them with the tens and twenties into the bag. Then he flipped the service switch, reloaded the empty cassette, and hustled back past the check-writing counter, running the bag through the open security door to the tellers' cages.<br><br>There, he retrieved a small strongbox from a drawer at the head teller's station. Beneath some dummy forms and a leftover stack of flimsy giveaway 1996 desk calendars was a brown coin envelope containing the cylindrical vault key.<br><br>They could have been a couple waiting for an elevator, except for the gun: Jem and the manager standing together before the wide vault door. Jem was holding her close, exploring the curve of her ass through her skirt with the muzzle of his .45 as he whispered something in her ear. Doug made noise coming up behind them and Jem's gun moved to her hip.<br><br>Jem said, "She says the time lock's set for eight eighteen."<br><br>The digital clock built into the vault door said 8:17. They stood for that one minute in silence, Doug behind the manager, listening to her breathing, watching the hands of her self-hugging arms grip her sides.<br><br>The clock changed to 8:18. Doug inserted the key over the thick black dial.<br><br>"We know all about panic codes," Jem told the manager. "Now open it clean."<br><br>Her hand came out stiffly, steadying itself against the cool steel door and leaving a brief, steamy palm print there before starting in on the dial. When she hesitated after the second turn, Doug knew she had made a mistake.<br><br>"No fucking stalling," said Jem.<br><br>She dried her quivering hand on her skirt. The second time, she made it past the third number of the combination before her nerves betrayed her, her fingers twisting the dial too far.<br><br>"For Christ!" said Jem.<br><br>"I'm sorry!" she wailed, half in anger, half in terror.<br><br>Jem put the gun to her ear. "You have kids?"<br><br>She veered away from him, her voice strangled. "No."<br><br>"A husband? Boyfriend?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Christ! Parents, then. Do you have parents? Who the fuck can I threaten?"<br><br>Doug stepped in, easing Jem's gun away from her face. "How many attempts before the lock triggers a duress delay?"<br><br>She swallowed. "Three."<br><br>Doug said, "And how long until it can be opened again after that?"<br><br>"I think -- fifteen minutes."<br><br>"Write it down," said Jem. "Write out the combination, I will fucking do it myself."<br><br>Doug looked at her grimacing face in profile, feeling her fear. "You don't want us here another fifteen minutes."<br><br>She considered that a second, then reached fast for the dial, her hand darting like a bird from a cage. Doug caught her wrist, held it firm.<br><br>"Slow," he said. "Take your time. Once you start, do not stop."<br><br>She wrapped a fist around her thumb. When he released her, her hand went cautiously to the dial. Her fingers obeyed her this time, shaking again only as she approached the final number. The interior clack was audible.<br><br>Jem spun the locking wheel and the door released, opening on massive hinges, the vault emitting a cool, cottony yawn after a long weekend's sleep.<br><br>Doug grabbed the manager's arm and walked her away. She paused in sight of her office, their entry point, where they had brought the ceiling down on top of her desk.<br><br>"It's my birthday," she whispered.<br><br>Doug walked her fast out to Gloansy, who put her back with the assistant manager, facedown on the floor. Dez stood near with his scarred mask cocked at a quizzical angle. A radio check, him listening to the unseen wire rising up from inside his jumpsuit collar.<br><br>"Nothing," Dez said. The police frequencies were all clear.<br><br>As a conquest, vault interiors always disappointed Doug. The public access areas such as the safe-deposit rooms were kept polished and showroom clean, but the actual money rooms were no more impressive than utility closets.<br><br>This vault was no exception. The main cabinet door containing the cash reserves was made of thin metal and fastened with a flimsy desk lock, which Doug busted open in one stroke. Despite the vault's hard-target exterior, once you were in, you were in. He ignored the heavy racks of rolled coins and instead pulled down stacked bundles of circulated paper currency. The color-coded paper straps that banded the bills told him the denominations at a glance: red for $5s, yellow for $10s, violet for $20s, brown for $50s, and beautiful mustard for $100s. He snapped them off as he went, fanning the wads of cash, spot-checking for dye packs and tracers.<br><br>Four cash-on-wheels teller trucks lined the back of the vault. The top drawers held about $2,500 each, and Doug cleared out all of it except the bait bills, the thin, paper-clipped bundles of twenties laid out at the bottom of each slot. The first drawer was the one tellers drew from during routine transactions, the one they emptied in the event of a stickup.<br><br>The second drawers were deeper than the first, containing higher denominations for commercial transactions and account closings, more than four times as much money as the first drawers. Doug again emptied each one down to the bait bills.<br><br>They ignored the safe-deposit room altogether. Opening boxes would have meant drilling each door individually, ten minutes per lock, two locks per box. And even if they did have all day, the Kenmore Square BayBanks branch served a transient community of Boston University students and apartment renters, so there was no point. In an upscale-neighborhood bank, the safe boxes would have been the primary target, since branches in wealthier zip codes usually carry less operating cash, their customers relying on direct deposit rather than paycheck cashing, purchasing things with plastic rather than paper.<br><br>Dez's blue palm halted them on the way back. "Asshole at the ATM."<br><br>Through the blinds, Doug made out a college kid in sweats playing the machine for allowance money. His card was rejected twice before he bothered to read the service message on the screen. He looked to the door, checking the bank hours printed there, then lifted the customer service phone off the receiver.<br><br>"Nope," said Dez.<br><br>In the middle of this, Doug looked at the manager lying behind the second teller's cage. He knew things about her. Her name was Claire Keesey. She drove a plum-colored Saturn coupe with a useless rear spoiler and a happy-face bumper sticker that said Breathe! She lived alone, and when it was warm enough, she spent her lunch hours in the community gardens along the nearby Back Bay Fens. He knew these things because he had been following her, off and on, for weeks.<br><br>Now, up close, Doug could see the faintly darker roots of her hair, the pale brown she treated honey blond. Her long, black linen skirt outlined her legs to the lacy white feet of her stockings, where jagged stitching across the left heel betrayed a thrifty mending never meant to be seen.<br><br>She rolled her head along her bent arm, just enough for a peek up at Gloansy, who was hunched over and watching the kid on the ATM phone. Her left leg began to creep toward the teller's chair. Her foot slipped underneath the counter and out of Doug's sight, poking around under there, then gliding swiftly back into position, her eyes returning to the crook of her elbow.<br><br>Doug exhaled slowly. Now he had a problem.<br><br>The kid in the ATM gave up on the dead telephone and kicked the wall before shoving bitchily through the doors out into the early morning.<br><br>Jem dropped the loot bag next to the tool bag and the work bag. "Let's blow," he said, exactly what Doug wanted to hear. As Gloansy pulled plastic ties from his pockets, and Jem and Dez lifted jugs of Ultra Clorox from the work bag, Doug turned and walked fast down the rear hall into the employee break room. The security equipment sat on wooden shelves there, and the system had tripped, the cameras switched on and recording, a small red light pulsing over the door. Doug stopped all three VCRs and ejected the tapes, then unplugged the system for good measure.<br><br>He brought the tapes back out to the front and dumped them into the work bag without anyone else seeing. Gloansy had the assistant manager in one of the teller's chairs, binding the guy's wrists behind the chair back. Bloody snot painted the assistant manager's lips and chin. Jem must have flat-nosed him on their way in.<br><br>Doug lifted the heavy tool bag to his shoulder just as he saw Dez quit splashing bleach, setting his jugs down on the floor.<br><br>"Hold it!" Dez called out.<br><br>Dez's finger went to his ear as Jem emerged from the vault, jugs in hand. Gloansy stopped with the manager seated behind the assistant manager now, back-to-back, a tie for her wrists ready in his free hand. Everyone looked at Dez -- except Doug, who was looking at the manager staring at the floor.<br><br>Dez said, "Silent alarm call, this address."<br><br>Jem looked for Doug. "What the fuck?" he said, setting down his bleach.<br><br>"We're done here anyway," said Doug. "We're gone. Let's go."<br><br>Jem drew his pistol, keeping it low at his hip as he approached the seated bankers. "Who did it?"<br><br>The manager kept staring at the floor. The assistant manager stared at Jem, a black forelock of hair hanging ragged and sullen over his eyes.<br><br>"We were gone," said Jem, pointing at the back hallway with his gun. "We were out that fucking door."<br><br>rdThe assistant manager winced at Jem through his hair, eyes watering from the bleach fumes, still sore from his cuffing at the door.<br><br>Jem locked on him. Wounded defiance was the worst possible play the assistant manager could make.<br><br>Dez picked up his bleach, hurriedly finishing splashing it around. "Let's go," he said.<br><br>"We've gotta move," Doug told Jem.<br><br>Another few seconds of staring, and the spell was broken. Jem stepped off, relaxing his gun hand, slipping the piece back inside his belt. He was already turning away when the assistant manager said, "Look, no one did any -- "<br><br>Jem flew at the man in a blur. The sound of knuckles against temple was like a tray of ice being cracked, Jem holding back nothing.<br><br>The assistant manager whipped left and slumped over the armrest, the chair tipping and falling onto its side.<br><br>The assistant manager sagged, still bound to the chair by his wrists. Jem dropped to one knee and hammered away again and again at the defenseless guy's cheek and jaw. Then Jem stopped and went back for his bleach. Only Doug's hooking his arm stopped Jem from emptying the jug over the man's shattered face.<br><br>That close, Doug could see the pale, nearly white-blue of Jem's irises within the recesses of the goalie mask, glowing like snow at night. Doug twisted the bleach out of Jem's hand and told him to load the bags. To Doug's surprise, Jem did just that.<br><br>Doug soaked the night drop in the lobby. He soaked the carpet where they had filled the loot bag, jumpy near the windows, expecting sirens. He shook out the jug over the ATM cassette, then returned to the counter.<br><br>The assistant manager remained hanging off the overturned chair. Only his wheezing told Doug the guy was still alive.<br><br>The bags were gone. So was the manager.<br><br>Doug walked to the back, bleach fumes swamping his vision. The bags were stacked and waiting, and Dez and Jem both had their masks off, standing at the rear door, Jem's hand clamped on the back of the manager's neck, keeping her from seeing their faces. Dez picked up her brown leather handbag where it had...</p><h2>A Trader&#39;s First Book on Commodities: An Introduction to the World&#39;s Fastest Growing Market</h2><p><p>You can make large profits by trading commodities--but you&#x2019;ll need significant practical knowledge of the associated risks and market characteristics before you start. <i>A Trader&#x2019;s First Book on Commodities </i>is a simple, practical and useful guide for new commodities traders.

Kelly of the University of Wyoming. Their well-chosen examples show how archaeologists have worked through actual problems in the field and in the lab. After using this book, readers will be better able to ask questions, solve problems, and discern &#34;truth&#34; from &#34;fiction.&#34; They will learn about the nature of archaeological data and how archaeologists do such things as archaeological survey and excavation. They also will develop their sense of scientific logic and gain a better understanding of career opportunities available to archaeologists. This edition&#39;s enhanced full-color design improves the visual presentation and enables users to more clearly see the key points of an image. A rich array of supplemental resources includes a new companion website, as well as the option to use the Doing Fieldwork: Archaeological Demonstrations CD-ROM, Version 2.0, also developed by the authors.</p><p>Robert L. Kelly began collecting arrowheads in farmers' fields when he was 10 years old. He has participated in archaeological research since 1973, when he was a sophomore in high school. He has worked on excavations in North and South America and conducted ethnographic research in Madagascar. He currently is conducting research into the archaeology of Wyoming's Bighorn and Absaroka Mountains, and Glacier National Park. A former president of the Society for American Archaeology and current editor of American Antiquity, Kelly has published over 100 articles and books, including The Foraging Spectrum: Diversity in Hunting and Gathering Societies (1995) and The Lifeways of Hunter-Gatherers (2013). Dr. Kelly has been a professor at the University of Wyoming since 1997.<br><br>David Hurst Thomas has served as curator of anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City since 1972. A specialist in Native American archaeology, Thomas discovered both Gatecliff Shelter (Nevada) and the lost 16th- and 17th-century Franciscan mission Santa Catalina de Guale on St. Catherine's Island, Georgia. He has led the long-term excavation of Mission San Marcos near Santa Fe (New Mexico) and recently returned to St. Catherine's Island for long-term archaeological exploration. A founding trustee of the National Museum of the American Indian at the Smithsonian since 1989, Thomas has published extensively. His works include 100 papers and 30 books -- most recently, the bestselling Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and The Battle for Native American Identity. Archaeologist Thomas likes "old stuff," including his 1961 Corvette, his 130-year-old house, and the Oakland Raiders.1. Meet Some Real Archaeologists. 2. The Structure of Archaeological Inquiry. 3.

Building on these strengths, our goals for the 11th edition have focused on the following:1.Incorporate new insights from scholarly research.2.Make sure the content covers all appropriate issues.3.Make sure the text is up-to-date with current events, statistics, and examples.4.Add new and insightful opening and closing cases in most chapters.5.Incorporate value-added global EDGETM features in every chapter.6.Connect every chapter to a focus on managerial implications.As part of the overall revision process, changes have been made to every chapter in the book. All statistics have been updated to incorporate the most recently available data. Currency is maintained through the integration of Connect and global EDGETM feature in every chapter.&nbsp;</p><p><p>Charles W. L.

It reveals a woman of great sensitivity and vitality, inspired through her knowledge of suffering with "a reverence for ordinary people'' and finding some healing for her own anguish in a quiet corner of Africa. </p></p><p>Bessie Head, one of Africa&#39;s best known writers, was born in South Africa but spent much of her life in Botswana. She died tragically early, in 1986, leaving behind her a fine collection of literary works. Tales of Tenderness and Power was the first of her works to be published after her death, and another anthology, A Woman Alone, has also been published posthumously. Both these titles reinforce Bessie Head&#39;s literary achievements, already evident in her novels Maru, When Rain clouds Gather, The Cardinals, A Collector of Treasures, A Question of Power, and her historical account Serowe: Village of the Rain Wind, which are all available in the Heinemann African Writer Series.</p><h2>Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach</h2><p>A workbook providing additional examples, problems, and solutions for use with Warren&#39;s Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach. Exercises correspond to chapters in the main text. Problems of special ease or difficulty are labeled for optional use. Workbook includes a formula index of all target molecules contained in the text and workbook.</p><p>This book will help students to design their own organic synthesis, giving a wide coverage of synthetic methods. The disconnection approach is used throughout so that starting materials are chosen after analysing the structure of the target molecule. There are forty chapters: those on the synthesis of given types of molecule alternate with strategy chapters in which the methods just learnt are placed in a wider context. The instructional chapters cover many ways of making each type of molecule starting with simple aromatic and aliphatic compounds with one functional group and progressing to molecules with many functional groups. The number and position of these functional groups provides the classification for these chapters. The strategy chapters cover questions of selectivity, protection, and stereochemistry, and develop more advanced strategic thinking via reagents specially designed for difficult problems. Examples are drawn from pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products, pheromones, perfumery and flavouring compounds, dyestuffs, monomers, and intermediates used in more advanced synthetic work. Reasons for wishing to synthesise each compound are given, and further examples can be found in the accompanying workbook which also gives many problems and solutions classified in the same way as the main text. The book will also assist more experienced chemists who feel they are out of touch with present day thinking on the subject.<br> <br> Workbook for Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach The workbook which supports this text provides an extra selection of examples. Each example is analysed in the same way as those in the main text with disconnections followed by synthesis, allowing the student to explore a wider range of types of target molecule and synthetic method. The main function of the workbook is, however, to provide a graded series of problems which extend the student's experience of the types of molecules being synthesised by organic chemists. These, together with the examples, are classified into the same 40 chapters as the main text so that it is possible to use them in conjunction with it. Each problem is followed by a suggested solution or solutions analysed in the same way as the examples and no methodology other than that introduced in the main text is required. Examples and problems are interspersed to provide a developing chain of argument.?The authors have succeeded admirably in the updating of a classic in the pedagogy of organic chemistry.? ( <i>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry</i> , August 2009) <p>?This book is suitable for advanced undergraduate students, researchers and professional chemists. Both the writing and the diagrams are simple and clear.?

Unlike the usual listener's guide, which begins with a discussion of the elementary materials of music, this book starts with the elementary experiences of listening.</p></p><p><b>Victor Zuckerkandl</b> (1896-1965), born in Vienna, came to the United States in 1940 and taught at Wellesley College, The New School, and St. John's College in Annapolis, where he developed the new approach to music presented in this book. His publications include <i>Sound and Symbol: Music and the External World</i> Princeton/Bollingen, 1969). A continuation of <i>Sound and Symbol</i> was completed before his death. It has been translated by Norbert Guterman and published as <i>Man the Musician</i> (Bollingen XLIV:2)."The teachings of Heinrich Schenker, the Gestalt theory, and the thorough knowledge of the world of sound provide the general framework for this excellent listeners' introduction to the structure and order of music. The author . . . begins with no more than the bare bones of the listening experience (the willing, listening ear concentrating on the single, successive, and organized sounds which it can learn to interpret as music) but builds up his case rapidly, logically, and rigorously."<b>---Catharine K. Miller, <i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>"Anyone who has taught a music course for general college students (as music appreciation, introduction to music, or part of a humanities core) will find this a fascinating and helpful book." (<i>Music Educators Journal</i>)<br><br>"This is a highly valuable book, one which should be widely read, not only by music lovers whose relation to music consists mainly in listening to records and radio, but even by the not-too-advanced student who has had some theoretical training."<b>---Ernst Oster, <i>Journal of Music Theory</i></b></p><h2>Salt and Steel: Reflections of a Submariner</h2><p>With characteristic warmth and humor, Beach relates the many highlights of his career as a submariner that began in World War II with the Battle of Midway and included 12 war patrols in the Pacific. Although he wears 10 decorations for gallantry in combat, among them the Navy Cross, his own accomplishments are never the focus of the book. It is instead the Navy as he saw it. Beach was on the personal staff of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Omar Bradley, just in time for the &#39;Revolt of the Admirals&#39; over the B-36 bomber and other controversies. Always an interested observer, Beach offers a fascinating look at this and other inner-service rows. As the naval aide to President Eisenhower from 1953 to 1957, he enjoyed a close relationship with the legendary World War II leader and later helped to further Adm. Hyman Rickover&#39;s nuclear power program. For those who have read Beach&#39;s other works, it will come as not surprise that this book is infused with his intense devotion to the Navy and concern for its future. He credits the Navy with bringing his parents together: His father was the captain of a cruiser sent to quell disturbances in Haiti in 1915, his mother a resident of the island whose family sought his father&#39;s protection. He tells of his experiences growing up the son of a naval officer and how that influenced his decision to attend the US Naval Academy--serving as regimental commander before graduating second in the class of 1939. He was first in his class at submarine school in 1941. But in addition to his many accomplishments through the years, Beach encountered disappointments. Among them are his father&#39;s court-martial after the wreck of the Memphis and his own failure to be promoted to admiral. But proof of his continuing devotion to the Navy are found in the concluding chapters of the book, where he makes recommendations for the future of the officer corps and ponders the effect of the submarine on naval warfare.</p><p>The latest volume by this outstanding American naval writer is both a collection of essays and the closest thing to autobiography Captain Beach is likely ever to give us. He writes with his usual freshness, grace, compassion, and well-informed opinions on his own life, his father's career, Admiral Rickover (who was indispensable to the nuclear propulsion program but impossible to deal with on the personal level) and the intrigues that cost him his promotion to rear admiral, and the role of the U.S. Navy in the twenty-first century, concerning which he also suggests reforms. Along the way, he tells anecdotes about his marriage of more than 50 years, his wartime service, the origins of several of his novels and of the characters in them, and the complexities of having the nuclear submarine <i>Nautilus</i> christened by Mamie Eisenhower. If this should be Beach's last book, it fittingly concludes his career as writer and seafarer. We can most sincerely say, "Sailor, rest your oar." <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Edith Wharton (Cambridge Companions to Literature)</h2><p>This volume of essays offers fresh examinations of Wharton&#39;s fiction designed both to engage the interest of the student or general reader encountering Wharton for the first time, and to be valuable to advanced scholars looking for new insights into her creative achievement.

Guinier (Law/Univ. of Pennsylvania) proclaims herself a ``democratic idealist,'' and in her introductory chapter she claims credibly that her ideas are not out of the mainstream. Unfortunately, as Yale law professor Stephen Carter (The Culture of Disbelief, 1993) states in a savvy preface, the withdrawal of Guinier's nomination deprived us of a chance at a ``national seminar'' on race and politics. Guinier's footnote-laden essays, aimed at academics, are heavy going, but her points are challenging. The Voting Rights Act, she argues, has been more successful in achieving the election of black officials than in altering the conditions of their constituents. She cogently suggests that winner-take-all voting systems that consistently exclude minorities are undemocratic. But she argues against remedy by gerrymandering, calling attention, in an example, to the status of blacks and Asians in New York City's new, geographically distorted ``Latino'' congressional district. Instead, she advocates cumulative voting, which is used in corporate elections. Thus, in at-large races for several seats, a minority voter can wield influence by clustering his or her several ballots for a preferred candidate. Yes, Guinier's view of the ideological homogeneity of African-Americans calls for debate, but her much-lambasted critique of who is an ``authentic'' black leader is actually fairly subtle, if murkily expressed. More an artifact than a full exposition of the issues involved, but a primary source response to a craven episode in nomination history. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Here they are--the law-review articles that last year cost Guinier her chance to become the government's top civil rights enforcer. In their unexpurgated plenitude (the footnotes constitute one-third of their bulk, though), these sources of the quotations that the media echo chamber amplified into the "quota queen" charge afford a two-step entry into Guinier's world of voting theory. The first, pronounced in "The Triumph of Tokenism," is Guinier's attack on the huge increase in the number of elected minority officials since the Voting Rights Act passed as a specious advance (within this critique comes her position on the celebrated question of an official's "authenticity"). The second step is made up of the remedies--especially cumulative voting (in which each voter casts more than one vote) and multiple-seat districts--that she argues will better represent minority interests. Unfortunately, Guinier nowhere defines those interests, which will probably lose her many a general reader. Still, everyone knows, or thinks they know, what racism, Guinier's raw main subject, is. It is repeatedly implicated in such crash-and-burn spectacles as Guinier's failed nomination, and the visceral feelings that nomination evoked guarantee considerable interest in these articles. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Icons &amp; Saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church</h2><p>An icon (from the Greek word "eikon," "image") is a wooden panel painting of a holy person or scene from Orthodox Christianity, the religion of the Byzantine Empire that is practiced today mainly in Greece and Russia. It was believed that these works acted as intermediaries between worshipers and the holy personages they depicted. Their pictorial language is stylized and primarily symbolic, rather than literal and narrative. Indeed, every attitude, pose, and color depicted in an icon has a precise meaning, and their painters--usually monks--followed prescribed models from iconographic manuals.<br> The goal of this book is to catalogue the vast heritage of images according to iconographic type and subject, from the most ancient at the Monastery of Saint Catherine in the Sinai to those from Greece, Constantinople, and Russia. Chapters focus on the role of icons in the Orthodox liturgy and on common iconic subjects, including the fathers and saints of the Eastern Church and the life of Jesus and his followers. As with other volumes in the Guide to Imagery series, this book includes a wealth of color illustrations in which details are called out for discussion.</p><p><br><strong>Alfredo Tradigo</strong> is the artistic director and art critic for <em>Famiglia Cristiana</em> magazine and has devoted thirty years to research on Christian iconography.<br></p><h2>Living with Art: With Core Concepts</h2><p>The fourth edition of this book won a first-place award for outstanding design and production at the 1995 New York Book Show.

For example, sending information across the Internet is better understood when one understands that prime numbers are connected to credit card transactions; that compound interest is connected to student loans; and that the perils of radioactive waste take on new meaning when one understands exponential functions are connected to the disasters at Fukushima, Japan. The efficiency of the flow of traffic through an intersection is more interesting after seeing the system of traffic lights represented in a mathematical form.

He won spectacular military victories (most notably at Brunanburh), forged unprecedented political connections across Europe, and succeeded in creating the first unified kingdom of the English. To claim for him the title of "first English monarch" is no exaggeration. </p><p>In this nuanced portrait of ï¿½thelstan, Sarah Foot offers the first full account of the king ever written. She traces his life through the various spheres in which he lived and worked, beginning with the intimate context of his family, then extending outward to his unusual multiethnic royal court, the Church and his kingdom, the wars he conducted, and finally his death and legacy. Foot describes a sophisticated man who was not only a great military leader but also a worthy king. He governed brilliantly, developed creative ways to project his image as a ruler, and devised strategic marriage treaties and gift exchanges to cement alliances with the leading royal and ducal houses of Europe. ï¿½thelstan's legacy, seen in the new light of this masterful biography, is inextricably connected to the very forging of England and early English identity.</p></p><p><b>Sarah Foot</b> is Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Christ Church, Oxford, and a foremost scholar of tenth-century history."[An] enthralling work of historical detection....In the pages of this remarkable biography--a work suffused with a rare empathy--AEthelstan emerges as a character of flesh and blood."--Hywel Williams, "Times Literary Supplement"--Hywel Williams"Times Literary Supplement" (09/30/2011)<br><br>"[A] compelling new biography....Foot manages to construct a remarkably clear vision of this king who deserves to be more widely known."--David Musgrove, "BBC History Magazine (Books of the Year)"--David Musgrove"BBC History Magazine (Books of the Year)" (12/01/2011)<br><br>"[An] outstanding biography....From a wide range of sources....Foot has pieced together a narrative that speaks of the realities of a vanished world.....Foot has amassed and arranged the evidence for AEthelstan life with great skill and flair....a triumph of historiography that celebrates a life rich in spiritual, intellectual and martial endeavor.

By examining AEthelstan in the various environments in which he lived and operated rather than through a more traditional chronological framework, Foot creates for the reader a persuasive portrait of a complex man - a pious and intellectual warrior king - who overcame a difficult childhood and disputed succession to become one of tenth-century Europe's most powerful and successful rulers.' - Richard Abels, author of "Alfred the Great: War, Culture and Kingship in Anglo-Saxon England"<br><br>'In "AEthelstan", Sarah Foot presents most successfully a remarkably vibrant portrait of a king whose visage has been clouded for many of us far too long.' - Patrick Conner<br><br>'Here at last is a biography doing full justice to one of the most important, but least remembered, Anglo-Saxon laymen: Sarah Foot comes as close as anyone can to interpreting AEthelstan's enigmatic personality and varied achievements.' - John Blair, author of "The Church in Anglo-Saxon Society"<br><br>"AEthelstan was perhaps the most important king of tenth-century England, but we know very little about him, and he has no modern biography.

Slatkin&#39;s goal is to offer students a genuine insight into all phases of women&#39;s contributions to visual culture.Preface <p> Women Artists in History is a textbook targeted at college students in introductory-level courses focused on women artists and the contributions of women to visual culture, women's studies courses, and surveys of western art history. It is written in a style that is crafted to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively for this targeted audience. Most students will bring little or no preexisting intellectual framework for comprehending this material. Therefore, whenever possible, I do not discuss a work of art without providing an accompanying illustration. I try to write clearly and succinctly in a manner that is similar to the way I teach, based on more than 25 years of teaching experience in such introductory-level courses. The topics discussed in each chapter have been selected to provide a foundation for these student readers. I hope that instructors of these courses will appreciate the text as a strategy for engaging their students and encouraging them to explore the fully published field, which is so rich and varied in methodologies. </p><p> This fourth edition of Women Artists in History provides this author with a welcome opportunity to build on the structure of the third edition and to incorporate a selection of the valuable scholarship published in the years since the last edition was written. In the third edition, detailed analyses of individual works of art, which had been objects of scholarly attention, provided the core structure of the text. This edition retains such focused discussions but incorporates some of the most compelling newly published scholarship. In this edition, readers will find each creator represented by one single illustration. This seemed to me to be the most effective way to balance the existing scholarship addressed in the third edition with the more recently published material. </p><p> The topics addressed in each chapter reflect the course of the current state of published research for each historical epoch. The issues vary because the material evidence of different times and places is so diverse. Therefore "feminist interventions into the histories of art," Griselda Pollock's well-known term for this scholarly practice, leads to an exploration of different types of issues for the five millennia of artistic production spanned by the scope of the text.' Feminists have suffered from the tyranny of meta-theories. We should not then seek to impose new methodological priorities for texts, course syllabi, or the research interests of our colleagues. I argue here for a flexible approach to the field of visual culture and art history. In this book I have tried to make selections from the broadest range of the outstanding scholarship in the field, which necessarily reflects a variety of methodological approaches. </p><p> It is unarguable that the contributions of women to the visual cultures of their societies go far beyond the small handful of women who became "professional artists." Women have participated in the visual arts on many levels, including the activities of amateur creators and as patrons, critics, and viewers. Whenever possible, I have indicated the roles of such women, especially as patrons, in the appropriate chapters. Such discussions naturally parallel the available published scholarship. </p><p> Interpretations of representations of women are also an important area of investigation for scholars studying the construction of gender distinctions in specific historical epochs. Art historians must address issues of "imagery" in their areas of expertise to deconstruct the "natural" categories of "Man" and "Woman" and their implicit power hierarchies. Such intellectual efforts provide us with one of the only escape routes for future generations to reinvent new, more tolerant, and more flexible definitions of gender. This scholarship is extremely valuable and important work. In this text, discussions of the roles of images of women are included in nearly every chapter prior to the eighteenth century. </p><p> However, Women Artists in History, does prioritize the works of women creators. The concrete material existence of these works of art by women artists with names attached, whenever possible, is the most direct didactic method to ensure that the contributions of women to visual culture will not be marginalized, minimized, or summarily dismissed. It is unthinkable to permit the art made by women to retreat into the invisibility and anonymity that existed prior to the 1970s. Therefore I believe that there is a responsibility to educate each new generation of college students with the outstanding creations of women artists. Given the limited number of illustrations that can be included in this text, I have chosen to include as many works created by women as is possible and practical. To shift the focus of the text to discussion of images of women, or works of art commissioned by women patrons but created by male artists, would inevitably result in many fewer works by women creators appearing as illustrations in this book. </p><p> It is undeniable that the text has a Eurocentric emphasis. This resulted necessarily from two factors, the current state of the literature and the practical limitations of space. There is simply much more scholarship currently in print on the women artists of Europe and the United States than for the creators from other continents. Furthermore, there are the physical limitations on the length of this book. Adding brief and, necessarily cursory, chapters describing women artists from other continents would have forced me to substitute some of the text devoted to the much more detailed and theoretically complex material which I have included. In the conclusion, a summary of the state of research on issues for global women creators has been added. This does not reverse the balance, but it does begin to point students in the directions of scholarship available on women artists of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand. As an introduction to this material, an essential part of the text is the updated bibliographies for each chapter. An annotated bibliography of general reference sources is also included. Students should be directed to these additional research materials, in English, which are published as books or essays, in refereed or peer reviewed publications. </p><p> Women Artists in History is like a "freeway" or "turnpike" for feminist art historical discourse. Each chapter is a' major "exit" into much more detailed scholarly work. Each subheading within the chapters is a road leading to more specialized studies. It is my intent that students use this book as a beginning point, a road map, to help guide them through what has become a terrain of complex and extremely sophisticated intellectual inquiry. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p> First, I acknowledge my debt to the sustained efforts of the scholars whose work is summarized in these pages. We are now benefiting from several generations of their expertise, that permits this text to become a very different book from the first edition, written in the early 1980s. </p><p> No textbook is created without a committed team. At Prentice-Hall I have been fortunate to work with a group of professionals without whose efforts this fourth edition could not have been produced. I would like to thank my revision editor Susan Alkana, whose support and insights moved this edition along at a crucial stage. I also wish to acknowledge Judy Winthrop's Herculean efforts to keep this project on track and on schedule and who knew when to say yes and no. As always, I am grateful to Bud Therien who has sustained this text through four successive revisions, and to the efforts of his assistant, Marion Gottlieb and Wendy Yurash, who were both patient and efficient. </p><p> I am most appreciative of the input from the readers who provided valuable suggestions in the earliest stages of this revision. </p><p> The students in my classes have constantly been an inspiration to me. Realizing that many were born after 1980 is a sobering lesson to all and reminds us of the need for "reiteration" and remembering that each individual class of students needs to be educated with a fresh perspective. </p><p> I gratefully acknowledge all those institutions, libraries, museums, and individuals who granted permission to reproduce the photos included in the text. </p><p> I wish to thank my family, Randy, Josh and Sara, who have lived with this revision with patience, tolerance, and good humor. Finally, I would like to recognize the support of my mother and especially, my father, who did not live to see this text printed.</p></p><h2>Silent Knife: Cesarean Prevention and Vaginal Birth after Cesarean (VBAC)</h2><p><p>The bible of cesarean prevention.

If Jenner could legitimately identify as a woman, could Dolezal legitimately identify as black?</p><p>Taking the controversial pairing of &#x201c;transgender&#x201d; and &#x201c;transracial&#x201d; as his starting point, Rogers Brubaker shows how gender and race, long understood as stable, inborn, and unambiguous, have in the past few decades opened up&#x2015;in different ways and to different degrees&#x2015;to the forces of change and choice. Transgender identities have moved from the margins to the mainstream with dizzying speed, and ethnoracial boundaries have blurred. Paradoxically, while sex has a much deeper biological basis than race, choosing or changing one's sex or gender is more widely accepted than choosing or changing one&#x2019;s race. Yet while few accepted Dolezal&#x2019;s claim to be black, racial identities are becoming more fluid as ancestry&#x2015;increasingly understood as mixed&#x2015;loses its authority over identity, and as race and ethnicity, like gender, come to be understood as something we <i>do</i>, not just something we <i>have</i>. By rethinking race and ethnicity through the multifaceted lens of the transgender experience&#x2015;encompassing not just a movement from one category to another but positions between and beyond existing categories&#x2015;Brubaker underscores the malleability, contingency, and arbitrariness of racial categories.</p><p>At a critical time when gender and race are being reimagined and reconstructed, <i>Trans</i> explores fruitful new paths for thinking about identity.</p></p><p><p>"Smart and timely, <i>Trans</i> examines the conjoining of 'transgender' and 'transracial' categories in the popular and scholarly discussions about Caitlyn Jenner and Rachel Dolezal during the summer of 2015. A lucid, wide-ranging exploration of tensions between givenness and chosenness in contemporary identity discourse, this is a must-read for anybody interested in the questions 'Who am I?' and 'Who are you?'"<b>--Susan Stryker, author of <i>Transgender History</i></b></p><p>"At a time when American culture is transfixed by &#x2018;trans,' Rogers Brubaker urges us to think with trans--to use the space that transgender reveals between culture and biology to understand how we experience race and ethnicity. Brubaker's thoughtful, humane, and conceptually elegant book provides a feast of insights about the varieties of identity that Americans today can experience and the ways that old categories continue to function in an unsettled world."<b>--Daniel J. Sharfstein, author of <i>The Invisible Line: A Secret History of Race in America</i></b></p><p>"This wonderful book exemplifies sociological analysis at its very best, deploying sharp distinctions that elucidate the complexities of the current unsettling of identities regarding sex and gender, and race and ethnicity. Discussing these together, each in light of the other, <i>Trans</i> brightly illuminates where and why they differ."<b>--Steven Lukes, New York University</b></p><p>"Rogers Brubaker's exploration of changing conceptions of gender and race is deeply informed, intellectually rigorous, and profoundly insightful.

I admire this accessible book and am grateful for it."<b>--Randall Kennedy, author of <i>For Discrimination: Race, Affirmative Action, and the Law</i></b></p><p>"<i>Trans</i> is an intellectual investigation giving clarity to an incompletely charted arena. Brubaker asks key questions, like why racial and ethnic categories seem to be thought as more biological and less legitimately variable than sex and gender. In a field dominated by accounts of experience, he offers an inquiry into systems of classification that is characteristically insightful."<b>--Craig Calhoun, director of the London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><p>"This provocative and perceptive book argues that the current 'trans moment' presents an unparalleled opportunity for exploring vernacular classification systems and political claims about identities. Transposing and generalizing to the arena of race and ethnicity insights developed by transgender and feminist analysts, <i>Trans</i> reveals the paradoxical deployment of social construction, contingency, and biology."<b>--Ann Shola Orloff, Northwestern University</b></p><p>"Taking up Caitlyn Jenner's gender transition and Rachel Dolezal's status as a self-proclaimed black person, Brubaker sheds light on the paradoxes of choice and constraint that swirl around conceptions of identity at a time when our cultural understandings of gender and race are very much in flux. This is a timely, judicious, and tremendously thoughtful and learned investigation into present-day debates. Everyone will want to read this book."<b>--Steven Epstein, author of <i>Inclusion: The Politics of Difference in Medical Research</i></b></p><p>"<i>Trans</i> offers an exceptionally lucid, insightful account of the contemporary discussion on &#x2018;trans' and an extremely useful investigation of the directions that &#x2018;transgenderism' and &#x2018;transracialism' might take.

But Dickens is no friend of the vengeful mob that storms the Bastille and cheers the guillotine. As with all of his stories, his passion is for the unforgettable and unrepeatable individuals he creates. The sorrows of the suffering masses, their demands for justice, and the indiscriminate fury they unleash take flesh in Madame Defarge, while the self-sacrifice that is the truest means of atonement and rebirth manifests in the unlikely hero Sydney Carton. In A Tale of Two Cities, humanity does not show its best side in the mean streets of Paris or even London, but in the intimate circle of loyal friends that gathers around the honorable Doctor Manette and his lovely daughter, Lucie.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen. The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself. The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions. Books are printed on natural cream-shade high quality stock, quarter bound in bonded leather with cloth sides, include a ribbon marker, and feature special printed endpapers. Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.<p>It was the time of the French Revolution a time of great change and great danger. It was a time when injustice was met by a lust for vengeance, and rarely was a distinction made between the innocent and the guilty. Against this tumultuous historical backdrop, Dickens' great story of unsurpassed adventure and courage unfolds.<br>Unjustly imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille, Dr. Alexandre Manette is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and safely transported from France to England. It would seem that they could take up the threads of their lives in peace. As fate would have it though, the pair are summoned to the Old Bailey to testify against a young Frenchman Charles Darnay falsely accused of treason. Strangely enough, Darnay bears an uncanny resemblance to another man in the courtroom, the dissolute lawyer's clerk Sydney Carton.<br>Brilliantly plotted, the novel is rich in drama, romance, and heroics that culminate in a daring prison escape in the shadow of the guillotine.</p>"</p><h2>Conservation Science: Balancing the Needs of People and Nature</h2><p><p>Conservation Science is the first textbook to teach the scientific foundations of conservation while highlighting strategies to better connect its practice with the needs and priorities of a growing human population. In a book review for ECOLOGY, Todd Fuller writes: "The authors present reasoned and provocative discussion of the challenges we face while traveling the difficult road that lies ahead, and the book is thus an imperative read."<br><br>Conservation Science was primarily written for undergraduates and beginning graduate students who are interested either in academic careers or in doing science-based conservation at government agencies, non-governmental organizations, or international institutions.

Conservation scientists apply principles from ecology, population genetics, economics, political science, and other natural and social sciences to manage and preserve nature. The focus of this textbook is first and foremost on protecting nature and especially Earth&#x2019;s biota. It also contains a heavy emphasis on highlighting strategies to better connect the practice of conservation with the needs and priorities of a growing human population.&nbsp;</p><p> Now used at over 150 colleges and universities,<i>&nbsp;Conservation Science</i>&nbsp;is an original and modern approach to conservation. Gretchen Daily (Stanford University) says it well: &#x201c;Based on unparalleled, firsthand experience, Kareiva and Marvier explore the innovative approaches to conservation being honed around the world today.

Peter Kareiva is the Chief Scientist and a Vice President for The Nature Conservancy, the world&#39;s largest environmental organization. He also maintains an appointment at Santa Clara University in California. Before moving to The Nature Conservancy, Dr. Kareiva was the Director of the Division of Conservation Biology at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Northwest Fisheries Science Center. He has served on the editorial boards of over a dozen different journals, has edited six books, and has been a faculty member at Brown University and the Universities of Washington and Virginia. He has received a Guggenheim fellowship and done research, consulting, teaching, or conservation work in twenty countries throughout Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He has authored more than 100 papers and articles, many of which were written in collaboration with colleagues in fisheries, agriculture, economics, and forestry. In 2007 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science. Michelle Marvier is a professor of Biology and Environmental Studies at Santa Clara University, where she has taught undergraduate courses in conservation science since 2000. She has published over 40 articles, is on the editorial board for Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, and regularly publishes articles with her undergraduate students. Dr. Marvier has also worked for NOAA Fisheries on salmon conservation and has served as an advisor to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and The Nature Conservancy on matters of statistics, monitoring, and risk analysis.</p><h2>Mushrooms of Northeastern North America</h2><p>This encyclopaedic volume, including 1500 species and 650 illustrations, shows the diversity of mycoflora throughout all of northeastern North America.

Welcome the dragon slayer: Cordelia Fine wittily but meticulously lays bare the irrational arguments that we use to justify gender politics.&#x201d;&#x2015;Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development, University College London</strong></p><p>Many people believe that, at its core, biological sex is a fundamental, diverging force in human development. According to this overly familiar story, differences between the sexes are shaped by past evolutionary pressures&#x2015;women are more cautious and parenting-focused, while men seek status to attract more mates. In each succeeding generation, sex hormones and male and female brains are thought to continue to reinforce these unbreachable distinctions, making for entrenched inequalities in modern society.</p><p>In <em>Testosterone Rex</em>, psychologist Cordelia Fine wittily explains why past and present sex roles are only serving suggestions for the future, revealing a much more dynamic situation through an entertaining and well-documented exploration of the latest research that draws on evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience, endocrinology, and philosophy. She uses stories from daily life, scientific research, and common sense to break through the din of cultural assumptions. Testosterone, for instance, is not the potent hormonal essence of masculinity; the presumed, built-in preferences of each sex, from toys to financial risk taking, are turned on their heads.</p><p>Moving beyond the old &#x201c;nature versus nurture&#x201d; debates, <em>Testosterone Rex</em> disproves ingrained myths and calls for a more equal society based on both sexes&#x2019; full, human potential.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2017:</strong> Fine knocks it out of the park with her smart and eye-opening investigation into why we give credit to (or blame) testosterone for so many behaviors. With a writing style that reminds me of Mary Roach and her gift for seeking out the ridiculous, Fine puts under the microscope our assumption that testosterone is the wonder hormone that makes men risk takers and competitive and, in its absence, women less so. This might sound like heavy stuff&#x2014;like the gender studies classes I avoided in college&#x2014;but Fine invites you to laugh with her as she punctures outdated notions and points out obvious weaknesses in the mighty social (not scientific) barricade of sex-specific dogma and the daily throwaway comments that carelessly reinforces that wall. After reading <em>Testosterone Rex</em>, my new resolution is to never say "Boys will be boys" again. Because while boys are, of course, boys, we owe it to them&#x2014;and to girls&#x2014;to understand that they are not defined by this single hormone. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em><strong>Cordelia Fine</strong>, an associate professor at the University of Melbourne, is author of the much-acclaimed <em>Delusions of Gender</em> and <em>A Mind of Its Own</em>.</p><h2>Death of a Salesman (Penguin Plays)</h2><p>Willy Loman, the protagonist of &#34;Death of a Salesman,&#34; has spent his life following the American way, living out his belief in salesmanship as a way to reinvent himself. But somehow the riches and respect he covets have eluded him. At age 63, he searches for the moment his life took a wrong turn, the moment of betrayal that undermined his relationship with his wife and destroyed his relationship with Biff, the son in whom he invested his faith. Willy lives in a fragile world of elaborate excuses and daydreams, conflating past and present in a desperate attempt to make sense of himself and of a world that once promised so much.</p><p>Arthur Miller's 1949 <i>Death of a Salesman</i> has sold 11 million copies, and Willy Loman didn't make all those sales on a smile and a shoeshine. This play is the genuine article--it's got the goods on the human condition, all packed into a day in the life of one self-deluded, self-promoting, self-defeating soul. It's a sturdy bridge between kitchen-sink realism and spectral abstraction, the facts of particular hard times and universal themes. As Christopher Bigsby's mildly interesting afterword in this 50th-anniversary edition points out (as does Miller in his memoir, <i>Timebends</i>), Willy is closely based on the playwright's sad, absurd salesman uncle, Manny. But of course Miller made Manny into Everyman, and gave him the name of the crime commissioner Lohmann in Fritz Lang's angst-ridden 1932 Nazi parable, <i>The Testament of Dr. Mabuse</i>.<p> The tragedy of Loman the all-American dreamer and loser works eternally, on the page as on the stage. A lot of plays made history around 1949, but none have stepped out of history into the classic canon as <i>Salesman</i> has. Great as it was, Tennessee Williams's work can't be revived as vividly as this play still is, all over the world. (This edition has edifying pictures of Lee J. Cobb's 1949 and Brian Dennehy's 1999 performances.) It connects Aristotle, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, <i>On the Waterfront</i>, David Mamet, and the archetypal American movie antihero. It even transcends its author's tragic flaw of pious preachiness (which undoes his snoozy <i>The Crucible</i>, unfortunately his most-produced play).</p><p> No doubt you've seen Willy Loman's story at least once. It's still worth reading. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Stacy Keach and Jane Kaczmarek stars in Arthur Miller's 1949 masterpiece, a searing portrait of the physical, emotional, and psychological costs of the American dream. Willy Loman (Keach) is the play's iconic traveling salesman, whose family is torn apart by his desperate obsession with greatness and social acceptance. As his two sons cast about aimlessly for their station in life, Willy begins to come unraveled when the reality of his life threatens his long-cherished illusions. <p> A full cast L.A.

In this volume she shows how to use the mirroring qualities of the Tarot to examine one's life and to create a doorway to other realms of possibility. <p>Tarot Mirrors incorporates the work of 19th century French Taroist, Papus, and Jane Roberts' channeled wisdom from Seth with Ms. Greer's own approach to Tarot as a tool for self-realization. The result is an entirely new synthesis of Tarot knowledge with powerful new layouts and processes for creating one's own reality.</p></p><p></p><h2>Going to the Source, Vol. 2: The Bedford Reader in American History, 3rd Edition</h2><p>Many document readers offer lots of sources, but only <i>Going to the Source</i> combines a rich diversity of primary and secondary sources with in-depth instructions for <i>how </i>and <i>when</i> to use each type of source.

The covert and controversial "Brides for Indians" program, launched by the administration of Ulysses S. Grant, is intended to help assimilate the Indians into the white man's world. Toward that end May and her friends embark upon the adventure of their lifetime.

It's a superb tale of sorrow, suspense, exultation, and triumph that leaves the reader waiting to turn the page and wonderfully wrung out at the end." --Winston Groom, author of <i>Forrest Gump</i></p><p> "The best writing transports readers to another time and place, so that when they reluctantly close the book, they are astonished to find themselves returned to their everyday lives. <i>One Thousand White Women</i> is such a book. Jim Fergus so skillfully envelopes us in the heart and mind of the main character, May Dodd, that we weep when she mourns, we shake our fist at anyone who tries to sway her course, and our hearts pound when she is in danger." --<i>Colorado Springs Gazette</i></p><p> "An impressive historical...terse, convincing, and affecting." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p>Praise for One Thousand White Women <p>"Jim Fergus's One Thousand White Women is a splendid, fresh, and engaging novel.

What Jim Fergus has done within these pages is give life and voice to an aspect of the American West and its native peoples that has been, if not covered up, too long overlooked. It is a tremendous achievement by a remarkable writer." -David Seybold, editor of Boats and Fathers and Sons </p><p>"Jim Fergus's powerful first novel is a surefire winner. I read it nonstop and would now like to propose a hunderd-year moratorium on all books about white women in the Old West, since it will take the rest of us at least that long to amass the research-not to mention the compassion-needed to equal this fine work. A masterful job!" -Robert F. Jones, author of Tie My Bones to Her Back </p><p>"This is a rich, beautifully conceived, rollicking novel, literally bursting with original characters and with the profound joy and heartbreak of the real history of the American West.

Some elements of leadership are almost certainly genetic and there is no escaping the fact that we are all products of our upbringing and our environment. As the saying goes, &#x2018;An apple never falls far from the tree that bore it&#x2019;. Well, as anyone who knows my mother Eve or my late father Ted will testify, I am certainly no exception to the rule. I recognise a lot of traits in myself that I have clearly inherited from my parents &#x2013; mostly good &#x2013; although just a few of the things that drove me nuts about my mum and dad when I was a kid almost certainly had the same effect on my own children.</p><p>From my first memories of her, my mum was always on the go, buzzing around the place. She had a seemingly limitless imagination for coming up with new business ideas. I don&#x2019;t recall her ever considering herself an entrepreneur &#x2013; that was probably only because I don&#x2019;t think the word existed back then and if it did nobody knew what it meant &#x2013; but she was certainly the definition of &#x2018;enterprising&#x2019;. Eve is a human whirlwind. No matter what the latest big thing was, she&#x2019;d always manage the whole process by herself from developing the ideas to crafting the products, to making deals with distributors, delivering and selling the goods. Nobody else could get in her way, it was her show and hers alone! I remember being very impressed by one of her more successful ventures, which was building and selling wooden tissue boxes and wastepaper bins. This one made it to some fairly swanky stores but they were generally more local ventures. She was absolutely tenacious, and taught me never to cry over spilt milk. If an item didn&#x2019;t sell, she&#x2019;d just write it off, learn from the experience and quite dispassionately move on and try something else. My sisters and I were always being dragged in as unpaid child labour, &#x2018;a labour of love&#x2019; she&#x2019;d call it, or the household chores would be delegated to us while Mum was in manufacturing mode. Obviously I didn&#x2019;t realise it at the time but there was unquestionably a lot of osmosis going on in that house that would stand me in good stead later in life.</p><p>Eve hasn&#x2019;t changed much even though she is now . . . oops. As she was the one that taught me never to talk about a woman&#x2019;s age let&#x2019;s leave it at &#x2018;she is rather well into her eighties&#x2019;. In her early life she had a spell as a West End dancer, and later became a stewardess for British South American Airways &#x2013; that was in the really glamorous days of flying when they had to don oxygen masks to cross the Andes. To this day she just never stops moving! I don&#x2019;t exactly lead a sedentary life myself but I swear that sometimes I have trouble keeping up with her.</p><p>One recent example was when quite out of the blue she casually announced her intention to organise a charity polo match &#x2013; not exactly the kind of thing one expects from an octogenarian! But this wasn&#x2019;t going to be something on the village green near her home &#x2013; she was planning to do it in Morocco! Surprised but far from stunned, I told her in no uncertain terms that I thought it a really crazy idea; not only would it be a huge amount of work but it would probably end up costing her money rather than raising it. She listened intently to what I had to say and then went ahead and did it anyway. Not only did it happen but it was a huge success and raised about a quarter of a million dollars. So while I was denied the opportunity to say, &#x2018;See, Mum, I told you so&#x2019;, I really had to admire her tenacity and so instead simply said (a very quiet) &#x2018;Well done, Mum.&#x2019;</p><p>Another of those family signature characteristics that I am told I have inherited is forever insisting on getting the last word in on any given subject. Well, just to show how flexible I can be on such things, I am going to let Eve have some of the first words in this book so (as a published author herself) I invited her to write a few thoughts. Based on what I&#x2019;ve just told you about her, see if any of the following sounds familiar? &#x2018;Apples and trees!&#x2019;</p><p>Dear Ricky,</p><p>If you're really going to let me say something in your next book, then here it goes.</p><p>We saw it in you from virtually the first moment you began to talk. But even before that, when you learned to walk we realised we were going to have our hands full; you were just a toddler but you were clearly someone who liked to do things his own way and on your own terms.</p><p>To make matters even more interesting, as you grew you perpetually had some crazy new scheme or other up your sleeve that you were convinced was either going to change the world, make lots of money, or both! On a few such occasions we would say things like, &#x2018;Oh don&#x2019;t be ridiculous, Ricky! That&#x2019;s never going to work.&#x2019; More often than not, however, your father and I instead opted to give you plenty of scope to learn by your mistakes and so left you to get on with your Christmas tree growing, bird breeding and all the other weird and wonderful enterprises you came up with. Almost without exception they all ended in some form of a disaster with us picking up the pieces &#x2013; literally and metaphorically &#x2013; but we&#x2019;d soldier on and just kept hoping that one day the lessons learned would help you in life.</p><p>And that certainly would seem to have turned out to be the case. After a rocky beginning, once you and Virgin had become an established success, Ted and I would often ponder on just how differently you might have turned out had we been more controlling, or some might say &#x2018;better&#x2019;, parents. What if we had insisted that you not take so many silly risks and, rather than allowing you to drop out of school at sixteen, forced you to buckle down and complete your education? Like your headmaster at Stowe, who famously (now) predicted that by twenty-one you would either be in jail or a millionaire, we too shared some very serious misgivings about what the future might have in store for you.</p><p>As we now know, of course, we needn&#x2019;t have worried. What we saw as being a pig-headed little boy who was utterly determined to do his own thing, turned out to be nothing more than the growing pains of a budding entrepreneur. If only we had been able to recognise that at the time we might have had a lot fewer sleepless nights!</p><p>Love, Mum</p><p>I read that some wag once said of me, &#x2018;That Branson chap is the luckiest person I know. You just watch &#x2013; if he ever falls off a high building he&#x2019;s almost certainly going to fall upwards!&#x2019; Please don&#x2019;t hold your breath on this one as it&#x2019;s not a theory I intend to test any time soon! Others have suggested that I was simply &#x2018;born lucky&#x2019;. Perhaps!</p><p>In my opinion &#x2018;luck&#x2019; is a highly misunderstood commodity. It&#x2019;s certainly not something that drops out of the heavens, you really can work at helping it along &#x2013; but more on that later. For now suffice it to say that I came into this world a lot luckier than most people. I had the good fortune to be born into a wonderfully loving family where I enjoyed a safe and &#x2018;sensible&#x2019; childhood in post-war England. I grew up in a home where there were few if any excesses, but at the same time my two sisters and I never really wanted for much of anything, especially affection and guidance from our parents.</p><p>Looking back on that period of my life I have to heap praise on the stalwart efforts of my mother and father, as I certainly was not the easiest child to bring up. Apart from being dyslexic I was blessed with an indomitable spirit that, whether she wants to admit it or not, unquestionably came from my mother Eve&#x2019;s side of the family. Perhaps she recognised this kindred spirit in me as she was constantly taking the lead in trying to keep young &#x2018;Ricky&#x2019; (that would be me) in line. At the same time it was also very much a team effort with my father Ted, even if the two of them didn&#x2019;t always realise it at the time.</p><p>There are many examples of this. Like one Sunday in church when I point-blank refused to sit next to the son of a friend of my mother&#x2019;s simply because I didn&#x2019;t like the child. Despite my mum&#x2019;s loudly whispered protestations, I instead sat with a friend on the opposite side of the aisle. I really didn&#x2019;t think it was that big of a deal, so I was utterly shocked when I got back home and, for what might have been the first time ever, my mother insisted that Dad should spank my bottom. She loudly proclaimed that, &#x2018;The boy has to learn that such behaviour will simply not be tolerated in this house.&#x2019; As I was thinking, &#x2018;But I didn&#x2019;t do it in this house&#x2019;, Dad dragged me out of the room by the scruff of the neck and then, just loudly enough to ensure that Mum would hear him, proclaimed, &#x2018;Okay, young man. It&#x2019;s time for me to teach you a lesson that you&#x2019;ll never forget!&#x2019;</p><p>And he certainly did. Following his quickly whispered instructions, I squealed in an appropriately pained manner as my dad proceeded to loudly clap his hands together half a dozen times. In a conspiratorial whisper he then told me to go back in to see Mum and apologise while looking &#x2018;suitably chastised&#x2019;. It was all I could do to keep my face straight when mid-apology Dad gave me a huge wink from behind Mum&#x2019;s back.</p><p>Dad was really just a big softy at heart, but I am convinced that the way he handled the situation after church that day taught me a far more lasting lesson than a severely bruised bottom (and ego) could ever have achieved. I&#x2019;m not sure if my mother ever knew about the fake spanking &#x2013; if she didn&#x2019;t then when she reads this she certainly will &#x2013; but there was another more serious occasion when Ted&#x2019;s parenting skills have stuck with me forever. On the odd occasion I had been guilty of helping myself to a few pennies from the loose change that Dad used to unload from his pockets into the top drawer in his bedroom wardrobe. To my childish amusement I had also discovered it was the same drawer where Dad kept his secret stash of what we used to call &#x2018;dirty books&#x2019;, but I digress. Helping myself to his change was never something I saw as &#x2018;stealing&#x2019; per se. In my juvenile mind I was just kind of &#x2018;borrowing&#x2019; it and we&#x2019;d simply never established the repayment terms or structure.</p><p>As it turned out, however, I was the one who was about to get repaid by getting myself into a lot of trouble. We lived just around the corner from a sweet shop and I&#x2019;d been using my ill-gotten gains to buy chocolate, with Cadbury&#x2019;s fruit and nut being my particular favourite. One day, though, I&#x2019;d taken a much bigger &#x2018;loan&#x2019; than usual from Dad&#x2019;s wardrobe bank and promptly done my part to boost Cadbury&#x2019;s shareholder value. The &#x2018;old lady&#x2019; who owned the shop, who at the time was probably all of forty years old, quickly smelled a rat. She said nothing to me, but the next time I was in her shop in the company of my father she staggered me by blurting out, &#x2018;Now I don&#x2019;t want to get him into any trouble, Mr Branson, but I don&#x2019;t know where young Richard&#x2019;s getting all his money from. He&#x2019;s becoming quite my best customer &#x2013; so I do hope he isn&#x2019;t stealing it.&#x2019; I remember her words like it were yesterday and thinking, &#x2018;Did she really have to put that zinger on the end?&#x2019;</p><p>But then, just as I was thinking, &#x2018;Oops, I&#x2019;m really in for it now!&#x2019; my dad staggered me by putting his nose right up to hers, looking her straight in the eyes and loudly declaring, &#x2018;Madam, how dare you accuse my son of stealing?&#x2019; I was even more surprised when, after we&#x2019;d marched out of the shop, he never said another word about it. Sometimes, though, the power of the unspoken word can be a frighteningly powerful thing and my father&#x2019;s studied silence with me for the rest of that day spoke volumes. In addition, the fact that he&#x2019;d immediately jumped in and vehemently defended his light-fingered son&#x2019;s integrity made me feel more guilt-ridden and miserable than if he had berated me in front of her.</p><p>Dad&#x2019;s handling of the situation certainly taught me a hugely effective lesson. Not only did I never pinch another penny from my parents, but it also taught me a life-lesson on the power of forgiveness and giving people a second chance. I&#x2019;d like to say the incident also taught me the importance of &#x2018;giving the benefit of the doubt&#x2019;, except in that particular case my father was in no doubt whatsoever as to precisely what had been going on.</p><p>Some business leaders have built their personal brand images (and businesses) around their quirkiness and outspoken eccentricities, be they hard-nosed, authoritarian or just downright crotchety. Michael O&#x2019;Leary, CEO of the Irish airline Ryanair, once described his ideal customer as &#x2018;someone with a pulse and a credit card&#x2019; and in the same &#x2018;Lunch with the Financial Times&#x2019; interview referred to the British Airports Authority as the &#x2018;Evil Empire&#x2019; and the UK&#x2019;s Civil Aviation Authority as a bunch of &#x2018;cretins and twerps&#x2019;. While nobody can question Ryanair&#x2019;s incredible financial success (last time I checked the low-cost carrier had built a market cap of over $13 billion), being voted Europe&#x2019;s &#x2018;least liked&#x2019; airline by TripAdvisor subscribers is something that would not sit well with me no matter how good the bottom line looks. American property magnate Donald Trump is another controversial character who seems to be either loved or hated by the consumer and is perhaps most famous for his &#x2018;You&#x2019;re fired&#x2019; line, something he seems to delight in telling people on his TV show The Apprentice. Unlike both these very successful gentlemen I have always believed there are tremendous upsides to a more conciliatory approach to life and business &#x2013; an attitude that even Michael O&#x2019;Leary is now publicly proclaiming he wants his much-maligned airline to assume, although it remains to be seen whether or not this particular Celtic Tiger can change his stripes. I&#x2019;m not a betting man, but if I were, I&#x2019;m not at all sure I would put money on this one!</p><p>While I wouldn&#x2019;t be foolish enough to pretend that Virgin&#x2019;s three airlines have never had passengers with valid complaints or that I have never fired anyone, I can honestly say that, unlike Mr Trump, the latter is not something I have ever taken the slightest pleasure in doing. On the contrary, I will usually move heaven and earth to avoid letting someone go, as when it comes to such a last resort I feel both sides have somehow failed each other. It&#x2019;s so much better, where possible, to try and forgive offenders and give them a second chance, just like my mother and father did so often with me as a child.</p><p>I had a very similar incident to my sweet shop experience much later in life only this time it was me who got to play the role of my dad. One day while sitting at Virgin Records I took a phone call from the owner of a nearby record shop who wanted to tip me off to the fact that one of our employees, whom he named, had been offering him piles of brand-new Virgin Records at suspiciously low prices and on a cash-only basis. When he signed off with the words, &#x2018;I just hope he&#x2019;s not stealing them&#x2019;, I had a definite dï¿½jï¿½ vu moment as my mind flashed back to my identical sweet shop indictment as a boy.</p><p>Sadly, the person that the record shop man named happened to be someone we considered to be one of our brighter young A &amp; R people and, much as I dislike these kinds of confrontation, on this occasion I had no option but to haul him into the office and repeat what I had just been told.

He was educated in several Parisian private schools and the Collï¿½ge Bourbon. The elder Dumas acknowledged him as his natural son and for some time made him his constant companion. In 1847, the younger Dumas published his first novel, <i>Adventures of Four Women and a Parrot</i>, followed a year later by <i>Camille (The Lady of the Camellias)</i>, and ten other novels over the next decade. Following the great success of the dramatic version of <i>Camille</i>, Dumas was gradually drawn away from the novel to the stage. He was elected to the French Academy in 1874 and continued to produce a long line of successful plays until his death.<br><br><b>Toril Moi </b>is James B.

In 1847, after traveling in Spain and North Africa, Dumas had returned to Paris in time to see posters displayed throughout the city for a sale of great interest to him. For four days, from Wednesday, February 24, to Saturday, February 27, the entire contents of 11 boulevard de la Madeleine were to be auctioned&#x2014;inlaid rosewood antiques, Sï¿½vres vases and Saxe porcelain, bronze figurines, paintings, drawings, a library of French classics, a wardrobe of cashmere, ball gowns, and furs, as well as caskets of exquisite jewels. These were the possessions of Marie Duplessis, the famous young courtesan, who had died of tuberculosis on February 3. She, too, was twenty-three, and had been Dumas&#x2019;s mistress eighteen months earlier.</p><p>At the public preview on February 23, it seemed that all Paris had crammed into Duplessis&#x2019;s apartment, while carriages arriving from the grand faubourgs blocked the boulevard in front of the house. &#x201c;Every different world was there,&#x201d; reported Thï¿½ophile Gautier. &#x201c;The best and the worst elbowed each other in the palace of this deceased queen.&#x201d; When Dumas joined the throng, he watched well-known courtesans being eyed by grandes dames, who were using the sale as a pretext to study these elegant women with whom they would never otherwise have allowed themselves to mingle. As he moved through familiar rooms still haunted by Duplessis&#x2019;s presence, he observed the prurience of people fingering her belongings and regarding every item as a trophy of prostitution. He learned that Duplessis had died in misery, the bailiffs having seized almost everything except her bed, and that night he poured his memories and impressions into an elegy he called &#x201c;MD.&#x201d; Like all the verses collected in his book of juvenilia, <i>Sins of Youth</i>, it is a poor imitation of the French romantics and shows why Dumas <i>fils</i> had no success as a poet. And yet the eye for detail that characterizes his best writing is there, and so is his instinct for pity.</p><p>Visiting his father the following day, Dumas broke the news of Duplessis&#x2019;s death, reminding him that she was the girl who had once taken Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i> by surprise by giving him a passionate kiss in a box of the Thï¿½ï¿½tre-Franï¿½ais. He talked about the poem he had written, and how going back to the apartment with all its associations had made him realize what a wonderful book could be made from her life and suffering.</p><p>&#x201c;Well then,&#x201d; said Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i>, &#x201c;you should do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Since the publication of <i>The Three Musketeers</i> and <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>, Alexandre Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i>, an irrepressible life force, had become a national treasure, while his son, despite the advantage of his name, was struggling to emerge from his father&#x2019;s immense shadow. Both had the same strapping physique, fine mustache, and features inherited from their ancestor, a Haitian slave girl&#x2014;dark, crinkly hair, velvety brown eyes, and a creole tint to their skin. Dumas <i>fils</i> had turned into a typical Parisien flï¿½neur and dandy, squandering his money on what today would be called designer clothes. He describes the look in his novella <i>Diane de Lys</i>:<i> </i>&#x201c;Cane from Verdier, tie-pin from Janinch, watch and chain from Maclï¿½, shirt, cravat and gloves from Boivin, suits from Staub or d&#x2019;Humann.&#x201d; His debts in his early twenties amounted to fifty thousand francs, and he was always borrowing from his father, and relying on him to pull strings. Jovial and famously generous, Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i> did his best to oblige, badgering his publishers to accept his son&#x2019;s &#x201c;magnificent volume of poetry&#x201d; by offering to write the preface. He urged his son to become his partner and collaborator, claiming this could bring him forty to fifty thousand francs a year, but Dumas <i>fils</i> was determined to forge his own writing career. &#x201c;I was athirst for fame,&#x201d; he once confessed. <i>Sins of Youth</i>, published later the year of Duplessis&#x2019;s death, sold only fourteen copies, and <i>Adventures of Four Women and a Parrot</i>, a high-spirited but unreadably long and rambling novel, made no impact either.</p><p>Father and son were constant companions, both relishing the louche pleasures of bohemian Paris and the liberties offered by society women prepared to compromise their respectability for a handsome young poet or illustrious novelist. Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i>&#x2019;s boyish exuberance made up for their difference in age, and his enjoyment of his son&#x2019;s biting wit was matched by Dumas <i>fils</i>&#x2019;s admiration of his father&#x2019;s erudition and renown. This bond, though, was recent. For the first seven years of his childhood, Dumas <i>fils</i>&#x2019;s only family had been his mother, a dressmaker, who gave birth to him at the age of thirty. A clerk without a cent, Dumas <i>pï¿½re </i>could hardly support himself, let alone a mistress and a child, but he installed them both in a little apartment in Passy, and appeared from time to time. In 1831, following the success of his first play, Dumas <i>pï¿½re </i>took responsibility for both his son and an illegitimate daughter from an earlier relationship. He wanted Alexandre to have the best possible education, and sent him to boarding school when he was just seven, and then to the Pension Saint-Victor, a daunting institution whose alumni included several famous men of letters. It was there that Dumas <i>fils</i> was forced to endure six years of humiliation and victimization. His schoolfellows, mostly the sons of rich, aristocratic families, taunted him for being a bastard, covered his exercise books with obscene drawings of his &#x201c;mother,&#x201d; and brought him close to nervous collapse. Privately he scorned these boys as ridiculous versions of their fathers, destined for the same tedious, bureaucratic careers. But the experience marked him for life, and he re-created every harrowing detail in his powerful late novel <i>L&#x2019;Affaire Clemenceau</i>. He wondered what the source could be of this compulsion to persecute, and whether his Caribbean blood had made him more sensitive to cruelty by carrying memories of tortures inflicted on men of a different color. These school years were the starting point for Dumas <i>fils</i>&#x2019;s relentless crusades against social prejudice and injustice. &#x201c;His great father, <i>le pï¿½re prodigue</i>, had been all for self,&#x201d; said the English writer Edmund Gosse. &#x201c;Alexandre would be all for others.&#x201d;</p><p>By May 1847, renting a room in an inn near his father&#x2019;s house in Saint Germain-en-Laye, Dumas <i>fils</i> had started work on the novel he was modeling on Marie Duplessis. The auction had given him his opening, and he began tinkering with facts, bringing the date forward to the middle of March and changing the address from boulevard de la Madeleine to 9 rue d&#x2019;Antin (Duplessis had recently moved from No. 22). Writing in the first person, the narrator who makes his way through the crowded rooms is not the anguished Alexandre of &#x201c;MD&#x201d; but an urbane connoisseur appraising the superb belongings of the woman whose identity he has discovered to be that of the courtesan Marguerite Gautier. And yet he is recognizably Dumas the moralist, prepared to interrupt the story in order to deliver a lecture. The boudoir&#x2019;s gold and silver bottles bearing the initials and coronets of Marguerite&#x2019;s various lovers prompt a digression about a middle-aged prostitute who has corrupted her own daughter and arranged the abortion that leads to her death. Dumas then recalls the arrest he saw of a weeping girl clasping her baby, a scene that, like many others he had witnessed, overwhelmed him with pity, and led to what he called his &#x201c;boundless compassion&#x201d; for fallen women.</p><p>Indulgence toward courtesans in poetry and fiction was nothing new. It was a legacy of romanticism, and a favorite subject of his father&#x2019;s contemporaries Victor Hugo, Honorï¿½ de Balzac, and Alfred de Musset, all of whom Dumas <i>fils</i> knew. Drawing on this tradition, he made Marguerite Gautier a descendant of Hugo&#x2019;s redeemed courtesan Marion Delorme, who gives up her wealthy protectors for an impoverished young man. From an earlier literary precedent, the eighteenth-century classic <i>Manon Lescaut</i>, he borrowed his plot device, beginning with the end of the story and having the narrator learn its details from the lovesick hero. Unlike Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i>, a man George Sand described as &#x201c;carrying within himself a world of incidents, heroes, traitors, magicians, and adventures,&#x201d; Dumas <i>fils</i> was no inventor. To be successful, and to make a work his own, he needed to describe, clearly and poignantly, what he had seen. The most vibrant parts of <i>The Lady of the Camellias</i> are the observations, scenes, and conversations he simply reported&#x2014;something his father understood. &#x201c;I find my subjects in my dreams,&#x201d; Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i> wrote, &#x201c;my son takes his from real life. I work with my eyes shut, he with his open. I draw, he photographs.&#x201d;</p><p>On returning to Paris in 1844 after a spell of living in Marseille, Dumas <i>fils</i> often saw and admired a lovely girl he knew to be Marie Duplessis. In &#x201c;ï¿½ Propos de la Dame aux Camï¿½lias,&#x201d; his 1868 preface to the novel, he recalls:</p><p>She was tall, very thin, with black hair and a pink and white complexion. Her head was small; she had long enameled eyes, like a Japanese woman&#x2019;s, but they were sparkling and alert. Her lips were redder than cherries, her teeth were the prettiest in the world; she looked like a little figurine made of Dresden china.</p><p>He had noticed her at the fashionable cafï¿½s and restaurants of the boulevard des Italiens; in her little blue horse-drawn carriage heading for the bois de Boulogne; at first nights at the theater or opera, where she sat with her signature bouquet of camellias, box of sweets, and opera glasses resting on the velvet ledge. There was nothing overtly seductive about her appearance; on the contrary, her favorite accessory was a cashmere shawl, which discreetly covered her shoulders and dï¿½colletage. One night at the Variï¿½tï¿½s theater, Dumas <i>fils</i> again caught sight of Duplessis sitting in her box, as he describes in notes he wrote as background for the actors in his play:</p><p>She was alone there, or rather, she was the only person one could see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. exchanging smiles and glances with three or four of our neighbours, leaning back, from time to time, to chat with an invisible occupant, who was no other than the aged Russian Count S&#x2014;. Marie Duplessis was making signs to a fat woman with a freckled face and a flashy costume who was in one of the boxes of the higher tier opposite to her. This good lady, sitting beside a pale young woman who seemed restless and ill at ease, and whom she had presumably undertaken to &#x201c;launch&#x201d; in the world of gallantry, was a certain Clemence Pr-t, a milliner, whose establishment was in an apartment in the boulevard de la Madeleine, in the house adjoining that in which Marie Duplessis occupied the mezzanine floor.</p><p>In the stalls beside Dumas <i>fils</i> was his friend Eugï¿½ne Dï¿½jazet, the son of the great actress Virginie Dï¿½jazet, and a fellow young rouï¿½. Well acquainted with the <i>entremetteuse</i> Clï¿½mence Prat, Dï¿½jazet volunteered to ask Prat to arrange a meeting with Duplessis. The elderly aristocrat in the box was Count Gustav von Stackelberg, a retired diplomat and Duplessis&#x2019;s protector, who left the theater with her before the performance was over. The two young men then joined Prat and persuaded her to take them to boulevard de la Madeleine. The novel continues to chronicle exactly what happened next. They have dinner with Duplessis, who drinks too much champagne and becomes more raucous as the night wears on, distressing Dumas <i>fils</i> with bawdy language that sullies his idealistic image of her. She has been coughing incessantly, and when seized by a particularly violent fit, gets up from the table and runs into her dressing room. &#x201c;Of those who were at supper I was the only one to be concerned,&#x201d; Dumas <i>fils</i> recalled in his notes to the actors. His immediate impulse was to follow her. In a candlelit room he saw Duplessis lying deathly pale on a chaise longue, struggling to catch her breath. Beside her was a silver bowl she was using as a spittoon, its water marbled with blood. Their subsequent conversation is reproduced in the novel, almost word for word.</p><p>Duplessis was touched to see tears in the eyes of this intense young man as he sat beside her and kissed her hand; such tenderness and concern for her health was something her self-regarding suitors had rarely shown. She wanted to keep him in her life as a platonic friend, the relationship a courtesan values more than any other. But &#x201c;Adet,&#x201d; as she called him (the French pronunciation of his initials), was already smitten, and craved the role of <i>amant de coeur</i>, which translates literally as &#x201c;lover of the heart.&#x201d; As he was too young, too poor, and too possessive to be able to share her, their affair did not last long. Dumas <i>fils</i> claimed it had begun in September 1844 and ended with the letter he wrote at midnight on August 30, 1845, the dates every biographer and Dumas scholar have taken as fact. However, the evidence of a simple rental bill and the appearance of a new young lover make it highly unlikely that they were together for a year. If this attempt to extend the relationship is apocryphal, it is also perfectly understandable, if only as an admission of the profound influence Duplessis had on Dumas <i>fils</i>&#x2019;s career. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s to her that I owe my first success.&#x201d;</p><p>Written in less than a month, <i>The Lady of the Camellias </i>was published by the reputable firm of Cadot in 1848. According to Alfred Vandam, an English journalist living in Paris, its frankness and topicality made it the talk of the town. &#x201c;It was in everyone&#x2019;s hands, and the press kept whetting the curiosity of those who had not read it with personal anecdotes of the heroine.&#x201d; The theater critic Jules Janin, who would write a memoir of Duplessis as a preface to the 1851 edition, was astonished at how much of her life was in it. &#x201c;People were anxious to know the name of the heroine, her position in society, how much money she had left, the ornaments she had worn, and who her lovers had been. The public, who desire to know everything, and who in the end do know everything, gradually learned all those details, and having read the book, wished to read it again; it naturally came to pass that, the truth being known, the interest of the story was enhanced.&#x201d; The reason the novel was reprinted only once by Cadot was that its publication had coincided with a year of revolution in Paris. Bloody February had brought barricades into the streets, resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy, and left the country in economic crisis. Rioting had doomed popular entertainment, and Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i>&#x2019;s Thï¿½ï¿½tre Historique, which Dumas <i>fils</i> hoped would mount his stage adaptation of the story, had gone bankrupt by 1849. Pursued by creditors, Dumas <i>pï¿½re</i>, now bankrupt himself, fled to Brussels. The son went back to being a jobbing writer, and his play of <i>The Lady of the Camellias</i> was put in a drawer.</p><p>Then came the change of regime on December 2, 1851, when Louis-Napolï¿½on was made President of the Second Republic. Prior to that, Dumas <i>fils</i> had tried in vain...</p></p><h2>The Yellow Wall-Paper</h2><p>First published in 1892, <i>The Yellow Wall-Paper</i> is written as the secret journal of a woman who, failing to relish the joys of marriage and motherhood, is sentenced to a country rest cure.

Narrated with superb psychological and dramatic precision, this short but powerful masterpiece has the heroine create a reality of her own within the hypnotic pattern of the faded yellow wall-paper of her bedroom&#x2014;a pattern that comes to symbolize her own imprisonment.<br><br>This key women's studies text by a pivotal first-wave feminist writer, lecturer, and activist (1860-1935) is reprinted as it first appeared in <i>New England Magazine</i> in 1892, and contains the essential essay on the author's life and work by pioneering Gilman scholar Elaine R.

Her observations focus on the strange effects of the peeling, fading, yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The Spencer Library has created a unique audio experience in this chilling tale with profound psychological and moral implications. Claudette Sutherland gives a remarkable performance. Her subtly expressive voice is so skillfully recorded that her soft intakes of breath have a desperate life of their own. The haunting beauty of Carol Nethen&#39;s original score can momentarily distract, but it supports more than it interferes, a tribute both to the composer and to the excellence of the recording standards. The listener is rewarded with a fully realized dramatic performance with a strong musical presence. C.T.

But nowhere has it been retold with greater eloquence and dignity than in Joseph Bï¿½dier&#x2019;s edition, which weaves several medieval sources into a seamless whole, elegantly translated by Hilaire Belloc and Paul Rosenfeld.</p><p>A tale of chivalry and doomed, transcendent love, &#39;The Romance of Tristan and Iseult&#39; is one of the most resonant works of Western literature, as well as the basis for our enduring idea of romance.

He has received the Rea Award for excellence in the short story, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize, and the PEN/Faulkner Award.<b>Bullet in the Brain</b>Anders couldn't get to the bank until just before it closed, so of course the line was endless and he got stuck behind two women whose loud, stupid conversation put him in a murderous temper. He was never in the best of tempers anyway, Anders&#x2014;a book critic known for the weary, elegant savagery with which he dispatched almost everything he reviewed.With the line still doubled around the rope, one of the tellers stuck a POSITION CLOSED sign in her window and walked to the back of the bank, where she leaned against a desk and began to pass the time with a man shuffling papers. The women in front of Anders broke off their conversation and watched the teller with hatred. "Oh, that's nice," one of them said. She turned to Anders and added, confident of his accord, "One of those little human touches that keep us coming back for more."Anders had conceived his own towering hatred of the teller, but he immediately turned it on the presumptuous crybaby in front of him. "Damned unfair," he said. "Tragic, really. If they're not chopping off the wrong leg or bombing your ancestral village, they're closing their positions."She stood her ground. "I didn't say it was tragic," she said. "I just think it's a pretty lousy way to treat your customers.""Unforgivable," Anders said. "Heaven will take note."She sucked in her cheeks but stared past him and said nothing. Anders saw that her friend was looking in the same direction. And then the tellers stopped what they were doing, the other customers slowly turned, and silence came over the bank. Two men wearing black ski masks and blue business suits were standing to the side of the door. One of them had a pistol pressed against the guard's neck. The guard's eyes were closed, and his lips were moving. The other man had a sawed-off shotgun. "Keep your big mouth shut!" the man with the pistol said, though no one had spoken a word. "One of you tellers hits the alarm, you're all dead meat.""Oh, bravo," Anders said. "<i>'Dead meat.'</i>" He turned to the woman in front of him. "Great script, eh? The stern, brass-knuckled poetry of the dangerous classes."She looked at him with drowning eyes.The man with the shotgun pushed the guard to his knees. He handed the shotgun to his partner and yanked the guard's wrists up behind his back and locked them together with a pair of handcuffs. He toppled him onto the floor with a kick between the shoulder blades, then took his shotgun back and went over to the security gate at the end of the counter. He was short and heavy and moved with peculiar slowness. "Buzz him in," his partner said. The man with the shotgun opened the gate and sauntered along the line of tellers, handing each of them a plastic bag. When he came to the empty position he looked over at the man with the pistol, who said, "Whose slot is that?"Anders watched the teller. She put her hand to her throat and turned to the man she'd been talked to. He nodded. "Mine," she said."Then get your ugly ass in gear and fill that bag.""There you go," Anders said to the woman in front of him. "Justice is done.""Hey! Bright boy! Did I tell you to talk?""No," Anders said."Then shut your trap.""Did you hear that?" Anders said. "'Bright boy.'" Right of out <i>The Killers.</i>""Please, be quiet," the woman said."Hey, you deaf or what?" The man with the pistol walked over to Anders and poked the weapon into his gut. "You think I'm playing games?""No," Anders said, but the barrel tickled like a stiff finger and he had to fight back the titters. He did this by making himself stare into the man's eyes, which were clearly visible behind the holes in the mask: pale blue and rawly red rimmed. The man's left eyelid kept twitching. He breathed out a piercing, ammoniac smell that shocked Anders more than anything that had happened, and he was beginning to develop a sense of unease when the man prodded him again with the pistol."You like me, bright boy?" he said. "You want to suck my dick?""No," Anders said."Then stop looking at me."Anders fixed his gaze on the man's shiny wing-tip shoes."Not down there. Up there." He stuck the pistol under Anders's chin and pushed it upward until he was looking at the ceiling.Anders had never paid much attention to that part of the bank, a pompous old building with marble floors and counters and gilt scrollwork over the tellers' cages. The domed ceiling had been decorated with mythological figures whose fleshy, toga-draped ugliness Anders had taken in at a glance many years earlier and afterward declined to notice. Now he had no choice but to scrutinize the painter's work. It was even worse than he remembered, and all of it executed with the utmost gravity. The artist had a few tricks up his sleeve and used them again and again&#x2014;a certain rosy blush on the underside of the clouds, a coy backward glance on the faces of the cupids and fauns. The ceiling was crowded with various dramas, but the one that caught Anders's eye was Zeus and Europa&#x2014;portrayed, in this rendition, as a bull ogling a cow from behind a haystack. To make the cow sexy, the painter had canted her hips suggestively and given her long, droppy eyelashes through which she gazed back at the bull with sultry welcome. The bull wore a smirk and his eyebrows were arched. If there'd been a caption bubbling out of his mouth, it would have said HUBBA HUBBA."What's so funny, bright boy?""Nothing.""You think I'm comical? You think I'm some kind of clown?""No.""You think you can fuck with me?""No.""Fuck with me again, you're history. <i>Capiche?</i>"Anders burst out laughing. He covered his mouth with both hands and said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," then snorted helplessly through his fingers and said, "<i>Capiche</i>&#x2014;oh, God, <i>capiche</i>," and at that the man with the pistol raised the pistol and shot Anders right through the head.The bullet smashed Anders's skull and plowed through his brain and exited behind his right ear, scattering shards of bone into the cerebral cortex, the corpus callosum, back toward the basal ganglia, and down into the thalamus. But before all this occurred, the first appearance of the bullet in the cerebrum set off a crackling chain of ion transports and neurotransmissions. Because of their peculiar origin these traced a peculiar pattern, flukishly calling to life a summer afternoon some forty years past, and lost since lost to memory. After striking the cranium the bullet was moving at nine hundred feet per second, a pathetically sluggish, glacial pace compared with the synaptic lightning that flashed around it. Once in the brain, that is, the bullet came under the mediation of brain time, which gave Anders plenty of time to contemplate the scene that, in a phrase he would have abhorred, "passed before his eyes."It is worth noting what Anders did not remember, given what he did recall. He did not remember his first lover, Sherry, or what he had most madly loved about her, before it came to irritate him&#x2014;her unembarrassed carnality, and especially the cordial way she had with his unit, which she called Mr. Mole, as in <i>Uh-oh, looks like Mr. Mole wants to play</i>. Anders did not remember his wife, whom he had also loved before she exhausted him with her predictability, or his daughter, now a sullen professor of economics at Dartmouth. He did not remember standing just outside his daughter's door as she lectured her bear about his naughtiness and described the appalling punishments Paws would receive unless he changed his ways. He did not remember a single line of the hundreds of poems he had committed to memory in his youth so he could give himself the shivers at will&#x2014;not "Silent, upon a peak in Darien," or "My God, I heard this day," or "All my pretty ones? Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?" None of these did he remember; not one. Anders did not remember his dying mother saying of his father, "I should have stabbed him in his sleep."He did not remember Professor Josephs telling his class how Athenian prisoners in Sicily had been released if they could recite Aeschylus, and then reciting Aeschylus himself, right there, in the Greek. Anders did not remember how his eyes had burned at those sounds. He did not remember the surprise of seeing a college classmate's name on the dust jacket of a novel not long after they graduted, or the respect he had felt after reading the book. He did not remember the pleasure of giving respect.Nor did Anders remember seeing a woman leap to her death from the building opposite his own just days after his daughter was born. He did not remember shouting, "Lord have mercy!" He did not remember deliberately crashing his father's car into a tree, or having his ribs kicked in by three policemen at an antiwar rally, or waking himself up with laughter. He did not remember when he began to regard the heap of books on his desk with boredom and dread, or when he grew angry at writers for writing them. He did not remember when everything began to remind him of something else.This is what he remembered. Heat. A baseball field. Yellow grass, the whir of insects, himself leaning against a tree as the boys of the neighborhood gather for a pickup game. He looks on as the others argue the relative genius of Mantle and Mays. They have been worrying this subject all summer, and it has become tedious to Anders: an oppression, like the heat.Then the last two boys arrive, Coyle and a cousin of his from Mississippi. Anders has never met Coyle's cousin before and will never see him again. He says hi with the rest but takes no further notice of him until they've chosen sides and someone asks the cousin what position he wants to play. "Shortshop," the boy says. "Short's the best position they is." Anders turns and looks at him. He wants to hear Coyle's cousin repeat what he's just said, though he knows better than to ask. The other's will think he's being a jerk, ragging the kid for his grammar. But that isn't it, not at all&#x2014;it's that Anders is strangely roused, elated, by those two final words, their pure unexpectedness and their music. He takes the field in a trance, repeating them to himself.The bullet is already in the brain; it won't be outrun forever, or charmed to a halt. In the end it will do its work and leave the troubled skull behind, dragging its comet's tail of memory and hope and talen and love into the marble hall of commerce. That can't be helped. But for now Anders can still make time. Time for the shadows to lengthen on the grass, time for the tethered dog to bark at the flying ball, time for the boy in right field to smack his sweat-blackened mitt and softly chant, <i>They is, they is, they is.</i></p><h2>Advances in Understanding Mechanisms and Treatment of Infantile Forms of Nystagmus</h2><p>This volume brings together work from leading researchers in the fields of developmental disorders of binocular vision, strabismus, and both infantile and acquired forms of nystagmus. It contains four sections. The first section, <em>Basic Concepts of Stable Vision and Gaze,</em> deals with psychophysical aspects of infantile forms of nystagmus and the relative contributions of extraocular proprioception and efference (corollary discharge). It also contains an accessible review of current notions of spatial and temporal visual functions and spatial constancy in infantile nystagmus syndrome and latent nystagmus. The second section, <em>New Models and Techniques for Studying Gaze Stability,</em> reviews animal and development models for strabismus, amblyopia, and nystagmus. It also contains novel optical methods for managing the visual consequences of nystagmus and a study of the potential ill effects of video displays on children's response to near viewing. The third section, <em>New Therapies for Congenital Nystagmus,</em> presents basic genetic studies and clinical trials of drug and surgical treatment of those patients with infantile forms of nystagmus. The final section,<em>General</em> <em>Aspects of Normal and Abnormal Gaze Control,</em> pulls together a range of contributions dealing with normal gaze control, infantile nystagmus, and acquired disorders of eye movements, including new treatment measures. This book will be a valuable resource for all scientists and practitioners interested in developmental disorders of vision.<br></p><p>R.

According to the period's rhetoricians, that new affective language comprised not words but the tones, gestures and expressive countenance with which they were delivered. Consequently, an orator's primary obligation was no longer to communicate thoughts and feelings, but to display the experiencing of those thoughts and feelings, to make the auditor respond with an involuntary sympathy rather than with rational and voluntary consent. Preoccupied with the spectacle of sincerity, the quest for a natural language led paradoxically to a greater theatricalization of public speaking as well as to a new social dramaturgy and a deeply self-conscious performative understanding of selfhood.<br>Concerned with recovering what was assumed but not spoken in the realm of eighteenth-century speech and action, the book treats Jefferson (whose fascination with Homer, Ossian, Patrick Henry, and music theory all relate to the new oratorical ideal) as a conflicted participant in the new rhetoric and a witness to its social costs and benefits. Rhetorical and aesthetic issues, the author demonstrates, open up to larger concerns about the nature of authorship and subjectivity, the value of originality, the character of personal and historical agency (what it means to be an independent "actor" in history) and finally to the construction of a test definition of being an American: the possession of a sensitivity to what the Declaration calls "the voice of justice &amp; of consanguinity."<br>By demonstrating the intimate connections between the history of politics and the history of rhetoric and by tracing the larger issues of the Declaration to and through a wide array of cultural expressions - popular fiction, Windsor chairs, fast-day proclamations, fugues, ice-skating, trompe l'oeil wax sculptures, acting textbooks, and the accents with which Jefferson marked his reading copy of the Declaration - Declaring Independence offers, on the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth, the first full-length cultural contextualization of America's founding document, as well as an interdisciplinary brief for reconsidering and enlarging the kinds of "facts" that are traditionally judged to be relevant to the understanding of a major historical document. It also offers a wide-ranging interdisciplinary analysis of how a new model for the public presentation and the spectatorial consumption of private life became a defining element of American culture.</p><p>&#x201c;From the simple fact that Jefferson&#x2019;s text was intended to be read aloud as a literal declaration of political independence, Fliegelman has woven a truly brilliant picture of Jefferson, the document, and American politics and letters. . . . The result is a profoundly exciting new way of understanding the Declaration, its author, and the performative act of the Revolution itself.&#x201d;&#x2014;Isaac Kramnick, Cornell University.<br>&#x201c;Will more or less immediately transform current study of 18th-century American literature and culture.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mitchell Breitwieser, University of California, Berkeley.Jay Fliegelman is Professor of English and Chairman of the American Studies Program at Stanford University.</p><h2>Bullied: Tales of Torment, Identity, and Youth (Writing Lives: Ethnographic Narratives)</h2><p><p>In this examination of the ubiquitous practice of bullying among youth, compelling first person stories vividly convey the lived experience of peer torment and how it impacted the lives of five diverse young women.

While there has been considerable attention by practitioners and academics to development in urban cores and new neighborhoods on the periphery of cities, there has been little attention to the redesign and redevelopment of existing suburbs. The authors, both architects and noted experts on the subject, show how development in existing suburbs can absorb new growth and evolve in relation to changed demographic, technological, and economic conditions. <p> <b>Retrofitting Suburbia</b> was named winner in the Architecture &amp; Urban Planning category of the 2009 American Publishers Awards for Professional and Scholarly Excellence (The PROSE Awards) awarded by The Professional and Scholarly Publishing (PSP) Division of the Association of American Publishers</p></p><p><b>A guide, with multiple case studies, for redeveloping out-of-date suburban developments into more urban, sustainable places</b> <p>The last fifty years have been dominated by the reproduction of sprawl development patterns.

At the time of his death in 1957, Lowry also left behind a great deal of uncollected and unpublished writing: stories, novellas, drafts of novels and revisions of drafts of novels (Lowry was a tireless revisiter and reviser&#x2014;and interrupter&#x2014;of his work), long, impassioned, haunting, beautiful letters overflowing with wordplay and lament, fraught short poems that display a sozzled off-the-cuff inspiration all Lowry&#x2019;s own. Over the years these writings have appeared in various volumes, all long out of print. Here, in <i>The Voyage That Never Ends</i>, the poet, translator, and critic Michael Hofmann has drawn on all this scattered and inaccessible material to assemble the first book that reflects the full range of Lowry&#x2019;s extraordinary and singular achievement.<br><br>The result is a revelation. In the letters&#x2014;acknowledged to be among modern literature&#x2019;s greatest&#x2014;we encounter a character who was, as contemporaries attested, as spellbinding and lovable as he was self-destructive and infuriating. In the late fiction&#x2014;the long story &#x201c;Through the Panama,&#x201d; sections of unfinished novels such as <i>Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid</i>, and the little-known <i>La Mordida</i>&#x2014;we discover a writer who is blazing a path into the unknown and, as he goes, improvising a whole new kind of writing. Lowry had set out to produce a great novel, something to top <i>Under the Volcano</i>, a multivolume epic and intimate tale of purgatorial suffering and ultimate redemption (called, among other things, &#x201c;The Voyage That Never Ends&#x201d;). That book was never to be. What he produced instead was an unprecedented and prophetic blend of fact and fiction, confession and confusion, essay and free play, that looks forward to the work of writers as different as Norman Mailer and William Gass, but is like nothing else. Almost in spite of himself, Lowry succeeded in transforming his disastrous life into an exhilarating art of disaster. <i>The Voyage That Never Ends</i> is a new and indispensable entry into the world of one of the masters of modern literature.</p><p><b>Malcolm Lowry</b> (1909&#x2013;1957) was born in New Brighton, England, the youngest of four sons of Arthur O. Lowry, a rich Liverpool businessman and devout Methodist. Brought up largely by nannies, he attended the Leys School in Cambridge before shipping out &#x201c;to see the world&#x201d; on the merchant steamer Pyrrhus, an ordeal that supplied him with the material for his first novel, <i>Ultramarine</i>. Already a heavy drinker, Lowry studied writing privately with the poet and novelist Conrad Aiken in America before taking a degree at Cambridge. <i>Ultramarine</i> was published in 1933, and that same year Lowry married Jan Gabrial. They were never happy, and often apart; in 1940 they divorced, after which Lowry married Margerie Bonner, a minor Hollywood star whom he had met some years before. Starting in 1936 and while moving restlessly back and forth between Mexico, the US, and Canada, Lowry worked on his great novel <i>Under the Volcano</i>, which went through multiple drafts and was rejected by twelve publishers before coming out in 1947. During the last decade of his life, Lowry&#x2019;s drinking left him in ever worse health. He and Margerie lived for the most part in a fishing shack in Dollarton, British Columbia, but also traveled widely, and in 1955 they moved to Ripe in Sussex. Lowry&#x2019;s death two years later, among a litter of bottles and pills, was attributed by the coroner to &#x201c;misadventure.&#x201d; <br><br><b>Michael Hofmann</b> is a poet and translator. He has translated nine books by Joseph Roth and was awarded the PEN translation prize for <i>String of Pearls</i>. He lives in London."The Voyage that Never Ends...is nevertheless a gorgeous plum pudding of a book, full of tragi-comic insights..." -<i>The Spectator </i>(London)<br><br>"This year marks the 50th anniversary of [Lowry's] death, for which poet Hofmann has brought together a range of materials unpublished in Lowry's lifetime. Although virtually all of these poems, short stories, drafts, and letters were published posthumously in some form, they are scattered and hard to find. Highlights include the short story that eventually became Chapter 8 of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, letters to American poet Conrad Aiken, and various pieces based on Lowry's wide-ranging travels. Hofmann writes the introduction. Highly recommended for academic libraries." --<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"Here is a book to make all Lowry fans rejoice: a superb selection from his lesser-known writings - the stories, poems, letters, above all the unfinished novels he struggled with for the last ten years of his life. The body of work they reveal - one of magnificent fragments and singularities - is often as striking, in its own way, as <i>Under the Volcano</i> itself, and it forms a riveting companion volume to that masterpiece. It deserves to become a classic in its own right." -James Lasdun<br><br>"Lowry is, needless to say, a one-of-a-kind writer: not prolific, decreasingly celebrated, enigmatic, tormented to the point of being tormenting and, as it happens, brilliant and essential to any calculation of twentieth-century fiction." -Richard Ford<br><br>"Lowry 'was not really a novelist, except by accident'...he could equally well be characterized as 'diarist, compulsive note-taker, poet manquï¿½, alcoholic philosophizing rambler...[and] genius.'" -Douglas Day in <i>The New York Times</i> (Eliot Fremont-Smith)<br><br>"Interest in star-crossed Malcolm Lowry persists; the materials for a myth are there, in perfect adjustment." -<i>The New York Times</i> (Hugh Kenner)</p><h2>Beautiful Losers: Essays on the Failure of American Conservatism (Volume 1)</h2><p><p>The 1992 presidential election campaign showed just how deep were the divisions within the Republican party.&nbsp; In <i>Beautiful Losers</i>, Samuel Francis argues that the victory of the Democratic party marks not only the end of the Reagan-Bush era, but the failure of the American conservatism.</p></p><p><p><b>Samuel Francis</b> is a nationally syndicated columnist with the <i>Washington Times</i>.&nbsp; He is the author of <i>Power and History:&nbsp; The Political Thought of James Burnham</i> and <i>The Soviet Strategy of Terror</i>.</p>This collection of provocative articles and review essays by a Washington Times columnist deals variously with the quarrel between the Old Right and the Neoconservatives, the emergence in the last decade of multiculturalism and political correctness, as well as the shifting of traditional moral, sexual and social norms. Three essays are especialy noteworthy: a controversial piece called "the Cult of Dr. King" considers the apotheosis of the slain civil rights leader; a discussion of Senator Joseph McCarthy explains why his ghost continues to haunt us 30 years after his death; and an illuminating reevaluation of Whittaker Chambers elevates his standing as an American writer. Francis argues that virtually every cause taken up by American conservatives over the past three decades has been lost and that the conservative movement has transformed itself into near-extinction. The New Right "must recognize that its values and goals lie outside and against the establishment and that its natural allies are not in Manhattan, Yale and Washington but in the increasingly alienated and threatened strata of Middle America." <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Drafting Culture: A Social History of Architectural Graphic Standards (MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>An examination of the standard reference book for architects as both practical sourcebook and window on changes in the profession.</b></p><p> <i>Architectural Graphics Standards</i> by Charles George Ramsey and Harold Reeve Sleeper, first published in 1932 (and now in its eleventh edition), is a definitive technical reference for architects&#x2015;the one book that every architect needs to own. The authors, one a draftsman and the other an architect, created a graphic compilation of standards that amounted to an index of the combined knowledge of their profession. This first comprehensive history of Ramsey and Sleeper's classic work explores the changing practical uses that this "draftsman's Bible" has served, as well as the ways in which it has registered the shifts within the architectural profession since the first half of the twentieth century. When <i>Architectural Graphics Standards</i> first appeared, architecture was undergoing its transition from vocation to profession&#x2015;from the draftsman's craft to the architect's academically based knowledge with a concomitant rise in social status. The older "drafting culture" gave way to massive postwar changes in design and building practice. Writing a history of the architectural profession from the bottom up&#x2015;from the standpoint of the architectural draftsman&#x2015;George Barnett Johnston clarifies the role and status of the subordinate architectural workers who once made up the base of the profession. Johnston's account of the evolution of Ramsey and Sleeper's book also offers a case study of the social hierarchies embedded within architecture's division of labor. Johnston investigates what became of the draftsman, and what became of drafting culture, and asks&#x2015;importantly, in today's era of digital formats&#x2015;what price is exacted from architectural labor as architecture pursues new professional ideals.</p></p><p>George Barnett Johnston is an architect, cultural historian, and Associate Professor in the College of Architecture at Georgia Institute of Technology.<p>Beautifully crafted and of course well-illustrated, <i>Drafting Culture</i> explores the origins of <i>Architectural Graphic Standards</i>, an essential reference tool that is usually taken for granted. Like its subject, Johnson's book is surprisingly relevant as today's architects confront similar hierarchies of collaboration and radical new imagery for outsourced, high-speed building production. A fascinating history filled with provocative insights.</p> (Gwendolyn Wright, Columbia University, and author of USA in the Modern Architectures in History series)<br><br><p>Johnston charts the rich debates about the social-democratic possibilities of modern architecture and planning that accompanied, resisted, and at times advanced the industrialization of architectural labor. His account of the tensions between Frederick Ackerman's reformist agenda and the codification of draftsmanship in the pages of <i>Architectural Graphic Standards,</i> produced by Ackerman's employees Charles Ramsey and Harold Sleeper, is especially welcome at a time when euphoria over digital technology threatens to induce historical amnesia and political complacency among practitioners.</p> (Casey Nelson Blake, Professor of History and Director of American Studies, Columbia University)</p><h2>The Amoeba in the Room: Lives of the Microbes</h2><p>A cup of seawater contains 100 million cells, which are preyed upon by billions of viruses. Fifty million tons of fungal spores are released into the atmosphere every year. And the human gut is home to somewhere between 500 and 1,000 species of bacteria. The more we learn about microbial biodiversity, the clearer it becomes that the vast majority of life has long gone unseen, and unobserved. The flowering of microbial science is revolutionizing biology and medicine in ways unimagined only a few years ago, and is inspiring a new view of what it means to be alive.<br><br>In <em>The Amoeba in the Room</em>, Nicholas Money explores the extraordinary breadth of the microbial world and the vast swathes of biological diversity that can be detected only using molecular methods. Although biologists have achieved a remarkable level of understanding about the way multicellular organisms operate, Money shows that most people continue to ignore the fact that most of life isn't classified as either plant or animal. Significant discoveries about the composition of the biosphere are making it clear that the sciences have failed to comprehend the full spectrum of life on earth, which is far more diverse than previously imagined. Money's engaging work considers this diversity in all its forms, exploring environments from the backyard pond to the ocean floor to the "mobile ecosystem" of our own bodies. <br><br>A revitalized vision of life emerges from Money's lively narrative of the lowly, one in which we are challenged to reconsider our existence in proper relationship to the single-celled protists, bacteria, and viruses that constitute most of life on earth. Proposing a radical reformulation of biology education and research in the life sciences, <em>The Amoeba in the Room</em> is a compelling romp through the least visible and yet most prodigiously magnificent aspects of life on earth.<br></p><p><br>Nicholas P. Money is Professor of Botany at Miami University and author of <em>The Triumph of the Fungi</em>, <em>Carpet Monsters and Killer Spores</em>, <em>Mr. Bloomfield's Orchard</em>, and <em>Mushroom</em>.<br><br>"Money enthusiastically presents evidence of diversity everywhere, no matter the magnification. ... This is a lucid and informative book. There is an impressive afterword of references and notes, and fine line drawings. So much that is lyrical and little-known waits to be discovered here - novelties that will appeal to new undergraduates as well as to incorrigible microbial enthusiasts like myself." --<em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"Nicholas P. Money, mycologist and professor of biology at Miami University, has made an excellent contribution to science in popular culture with his new book, <em>The Amoeba in the Room</em>."--<em>Kansas City Star</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Money succeeds, intellectually in convincing you that multicellular creatures count for little in the grand scheme of biology" --<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"Writing passionately about a subject he clearly loves, Money, professor of botany at Miami Univ. (Ohio), explains the critically important, but largely overlooked, roles microbial organisms play in the world." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Amoeba in the Room grew on me. I found myself reading a few pages every nightEL always curious to read a little more. By the time I reached the end, the author had succeeded in making a rather profound and permanent change in my world view. If you are involved in biology education at any level, including elementary school, I recommend you read this book. Like the microbes themselves, Amoeba in the Room is easily overlooked but carries an important message." --<em>Scientific Thrillers</em> <br><p></p><br>"Money's book offers a glimpse into the lives of these often overlooked bacteria, fungi, amoebas and other microbes. Money's light-hearted writing helps prevent the lingo from becoming overwhelming, though, and readers who can weather the tricky language will find a fascinating and strange new world." --<em>Science News</em> <br><p></p><br>"...beautifully written, Money has a great style, and a very important message. To see what is really going on in the biosphere, the only zone of life that we know of at this point, you need a microscope. Bacteria are the gods of humans." --<em>The Stranger</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Written with great skill and seasoned with wit, the book displays the expertise of the writer." --<em>San Francisco Book Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Money's light-hearted writing helps prevent the lingo from becoming overwhelming, though, and readers who can weather the tricky language will find a fascinating and strange new world." --<em>Science News</em><p></p><br>"Nicholas Money is an expert guide. This world will not seem the same to anyone who reads his book." --<em>The Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"This is a fascinating, amazing, and thoroughly enthusiastic sketch of [the] subject ... The book helps orient us to new biological horizons - and new philosophic ones." --<em>The Ecologist</em><p></p><br>"Money succeeds in driving hom his main point: biology isn't really about the animals." --<em>New Scientist</em><p></p><br>Featured in <em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em>.<p></p><br>"I found this book immensely enjoyable and I would encourage anyone wanting to know more about the huge swathe of life on the planet that passes us by unseen to seek out a copy." --<em>Dale Walters, The Biologist</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Unassisted Childbirth</h2><p><p>Laura and her husband delivered their first child without the aid of a doctor or midwife. Laura alone delivered the next three children, assisted by her belief that giving birth was a natural process for which a woman's body had been well designed. Therefore, she saw no need to involve the medical establishment. Her personal birth experiences confirmed her belief, and subsequent research has convinced her that with the proper mindset delivering one's own baby is the safest, most fulfilling way to give birth. Tribal women and animals can help show the way, if one is humble enough to learn from them. Shanley gives numerous references, both historical and contemporary, to support her theory. She tells of her own experiences in childbirth as well as those of other women who have given birth without medical assistance. Although many contemporary writers deal with the concept that we create our own reality according to our beliefs, no one has applied this notion to birthing experience to the extent that Laura has.</p><p></p><p>For many generations, society has assumed that childbirth, with its associated fear, pain, and risks, must take place in a hospital setting in the presence of medical professionals who have no relationship to the parents and their baby. Laura Kaplan Shanley rebuffs the context of this assumption, which treats childbirth as a disease rather than as a natural process. In <i>Unassisted Childbirth</i>, she calls upon the thousands of years during which women gave birth without medical intervention--arguing that with the proper beliefs, women are capable of and can opt for delivering their own babies, with or without their partners. Shanley, who had her own four children at home without medical assistance, explains how women's apprehensions contribute to most difficulties encountered in labor. In addition, she points out, only after the practice of placing women in infectious hospital settings began did the risk of hemorrhaging, sickening or even dying in childbirth increase.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Contrary to popular opinion, prior to the advent of the modern-day hospital, women and babies in healthy tribal cultures rarely died in childbirth. Women in tribal cultures often had such a relaxed attitude about birth that some of them actually gave birth while sleeping. All told, Americans spend $80 billion a year on childbirth. Could it be much of this medical intervention is actually unnecessary?</p><p>Laura Kaplan Shanley is dedicated to the belief that autonomous, unassisted birth is a concept whose time has come and should be re-introduced into human society as the ideal form of safe, joyous, and healthy childbirth.</p></p><h2>Technical Analysis from A to Z, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Millions of traders participating in today&#x2019;s financial markets have shot interest and involvement in technical analysis to an all-time high.

Evangelicals are radically individualist, but devoted to community and family. They believe in the transformative power of a personal relationship with God, but are wary of religious enthusiasm. They are deeply skeptical of secular reason, but eager to find scientific proof that the Bible is true. <br><br>In this groundbreaking history of modern American evangelicalism, Molly Worthen argues that these contradictions are the products of a crisis of authority that lies at the heart of the faith. Evangelicals have never had a single authority to guide them through these dilemmas or settle the troublesome question of what the Bible actually means. Worthen chronicles the ideological warfare, institutional conflict, and clashes between modern gurus and maverick disciples that lurk behind the more familiar narrative of the rise of the Christian Right. The result is an ambitious intellectual history that weaves together stories from all corners of the evangelical world to explain the ideas and personalities-the scholarly ambitions and anti-intellectual impulses-that have made evangelicalism a cultural and political force.<br><br>In <em>Apostles of Reason</em>, Worthen recasts American evangelicalism as a movement defined not by shared doctrines or politics, but by the problem of reconciling head knowledge and heart religion in an increasingly secular America. She shows that understanding the rise of the Christian Right in purely political terms, as most scholars have done, misses the heart of the story. The culture wars of the late twentieth century emerged not only from the struggle between religious conservatives and secular liberals, but also from the civil war within evangelicalism itself-a battle over how to uphold the commands of both faith and reason, and how ultimately to lead the nation back onto the path of righteousness.<br></p><p><br><strong>Molly Worthen</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

When it comes to money we think that striking it rich is the ultimate goal. I know because I used to feel that way. In reality, getting rich isn't the financial finish line. It's the first lap of a much longer race. I'm talking about ensuring long-term prosperity for you and your family: not just getting rich, but <i>staying</i> rich. That's what each and every one of us truly wants to achieve with our money, and I don't care who you are, who your parents are, where you live, or what you do for a living: you can do it if you let me help you. I don't care if you don't have two cents to your name or if you owe thousands of dollars in credit card debt. I am confident I can get you there. You may think of yourself as someone who's awful with money; you could be a person who's tried and failed to get anywhere with every single financial plan you've ever been handed, like so many failed faddish diets. Whether you're 16 or 60, sending your kids to college or sending yourself to college, I'm writing this book to tell you everything you will ever need to know and everything you must do to create and maintain the kind of wealth that lasts a lifetime. I want you to get there and stay there. </p><p> A lot of people who try to sell you advice about your money are doing it to make money themselves. They don't care whether you succeed or fail with their advice because they're just looking to sell books or earn fees. I made more money than anyone ever needs working at my old hedge fund, and if I wanted more, I'd start another one. I am confident that I could raise a billion dollars to manage tomorrow, but frankly, I'd rather help you. That means more to me than working for people who are already rich. Perhaps it's because I'm a good guy, or because I just want to look like a good guy, or maybe I do it because I love positive attention. Maybe it's because after years of making money for myself, it just feels right. At the end of the day, the "why" isn't important, as long as you're satisfi ed that I'm writing this book in good faith to help you. What's important is the "what." I spent fourteen years running a hedge fund, which means that the only higher purpose my job had was to make incredibly rich people even richer. I used to joke that my job was to move people higher on the Forbes 400 richest people list -- not a higher calling. </p><p> I've now spent the past seven years since I retired from the fund writing books and columns for TheStreet.com and <i>New York</i> magazine and hosting a radio show and two television shows: first <i>Kudlow &amp; Cramer</i>, then <i>Mad Money</i>. The venues have changed, but my goal was always the same: to share my experience and expertise with regular people to help them become rich. In this book, I'm aiming even higher than that: I'm teaching you how to make money and use it to ensure enduring prosperity and permanent financial security over the course of your entire life. The disciplines and the knowledge you need to build a firm foundation for your wealth and maintain it for the rest of your life are not the same as the ones you would need to make yourself rich by investing in stocks, the subject of my previous two books. If you're looking for long-term financial security, I would hope you'd set your sights higher. For long-term extravagant wealth, you need to know how to take advantage of tax-favored vehicles like 401(k) plans and IRAs; you need to know when you should buy bonds rather than stocks, not to mention the kinds of bonds you should choose; you need to know how to save for college; how to guarantee you have a smooth retirement; how to save; how to borrow; when you should buy a house; when you should be taking risks; when you should be avoiding risks; what you must teach your children about money; which mutual funds you should put your money in; and which stocks will look good for the long haul, the next twenty-five years. These are the subjects people beg me to address, and I am ready and willing to do so. I have the answers for <i>all</i> of the financial questions you, your parents, and your kids have about getting rich and staying rich. Don't be intimidated -- I'll explain everything in layman's terms, not in the Wall Street gibberish the professionals use to scare you into relying on them instead of using your own judgment. </p><p> But what about my judgment? You want to know where my advice comes from, and I don't blame you. Most of what I know about making money I learned in my years on Wall Street, first as a broker at Goldman Sachs, advising the wealthiest of the wealthy about all these lifetime issues, and then as the manager of my own hedge fund, Cramer, Berkowitz &amp; Company. I've had a long love affair with stocks, but stocks are only one of many tools, albeit the most important one, that we're going to use to create lasting prosperity for you and your family. I know better than most people the difference between having money and not having it, or having it and having a whole lot of it. I'm a self-made multimillionaire, and I'm going to share with you the lifelong disciplines that made me rich and have kept me that way. </p><p> As I said, I made my own money. I've also been poor. In fact, I wasn't just poor; I was homeless and destitute. In 1978 I spent six months living in the backseat of my Ford Fairmont while I worked as a homicide reporter for the Los Angeles <i>Herald Examiner</i>, unable to afford even rent money. By 1979 I had moved up in the world: I was living in the most spacious corner of my big sister's studio apartment in New York City. I was the last person in the world anyone was ever going to ask for financial advice, but even then I was diligent and self-disciplined about money. I may have skimped on the auto insurance and skipped on the rent, but I still put $50 a month into the best mutual fund I could fi nd, Fidelity's Magellan Fund. I have always been fascinated with mutual funds and managers, and I am going to tell you all about which ones you need and which ones you should avoid. I know what it's like to need money and not have it, and ever since those early days I have lived in desperate fear of poverty. Living out of my car with barely enough money to get by convinced me that I had to become rich, that no amount of money was too much, and that I would have to do it with more than just my meager paycheck. I would have to parlay that paycheck into something much bigger, using whatever financial resources I could get my hands on. I spent twenty years single-mindedly pursuing greater and greater sums of money until well past the point where more money made a bit of difference. I know it's possible for anyone to get rich and stay rich because I did it myself and I'm no different from any of you. </p><p> Like most things in life, getting rich and staying that way take a lot of hard work, a lot of knowledge, and a little bit of good advice. There are many ways to get your hands on a whole lot of money, though few of them can be called easy. You can invest in the right stocks, get a high-paying job, start your own business, or inherit the money, to name just a few. But there's only one way to make sure your newfound wealth leads to long-term prosperity: you have to use your money to make more money, and you need to do it the right way. It's hard work, and it takes diligence, but in this book I've already done a lot of the work for you. No, I don't have six easy steps to financial security, nor do I have three magic habits that will make you a millionaire, and I can't tell you the financial secrets of the superrich because as far as I know, they're just as feckless with money as ordinary people. People who promise that they can make you truckloads of cash and help you keep it as long as you follow their simple five-point program aren't telling you the whole story. Easy steps turn out to be not so easy, and advice that seemed great in theory turns out to be next to useless in practice. I suspect that many of these people have never made a dime <i>except in book sales</i>! I read a ton of these personal finance guides because every time someone writes a new one, which seems like every five minutes, the publisher comes to me to pen the introduction and give it my seal of approval. Many of these books are well-written, some of them by terrific people, but they generally don't tell you what you need to know. I swear, more books have been written about creating and keeping wealth than any one person could read in a lifetime, but I have yet to find a single one that actually tells you, in detail, what you must do during every stage of your life to develop enduring wealth and ensure that you never have to worry about your money again. So I decided to fix that problem by writing this one. </p><p> For most people, there are few things that are more confusing and frustrating than trying to manage their finances. I can't tell you how many people I've spoken to who agonize over trying to pick the right mutual fund and end up giving up, their money still in a checking account, because the decision was too hard and reliable information was too scarce. If you're looking for a financial plan, it's easy to get a broad outline, but very hard to fi nd anyone who will give you specific, detailed advice. But that's exactly what I'm going to do. Others are more than willing to show you the forest: save money, pay off your credit card debt, contribute to your 401(k), start an IRA. But no one will identify the trees, where the money is actually grown. How should you manage your IRA? What, specifically, should you own in your retirement and discretionary accounts? Which of the most popular mutual funds available in your 401(k) plan is the best place to put your money? I'll even recommend the best mutual funds, using all the data available as I write this book. </p><p> Too many books about money go wrong because they try to offer timeless advice. There's no such thing as great timeless advice. The really useful financial information is time-sensitive. ...</p></p><h2>Ginkgo: The Tree That Time Forgot</h2><p><p>Perhaps the world&#x2019;s most distinctive tree, ginkgo has remained stubbornly unchanged for more than two hundred million years. A living link to the age of dinosaurs, it survived the great ice ages as a relic in China, but it earned its reprieve when people first found it useful about a thousand years ago. Today ginkgo is beloved for the elegance of its leaves, prized for its edible nuts, and revered for its longevity. This engaging book tells the rich and engaging story of a tree that people saved from extinction&#x2014;a story that offers hope for other botanical biographies that are still being written.</p>&nbsp;Inspired by the historic ginkgo that has thrived in London&#x2019;s Kew Gardens since the 1760s, renowned botanist Peter Crane explores the history of the ginkgo from its mysterious origin through its proliferation, drastic decline, and ultimate resurgence. Crane also highlights the cultural and social significance of the ginkgo: its medicinal and nutritional uses, its power as a source of artistic and religious inspiration, and its importance as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular street trees. Readers of this book will be drawn to the nearest ginkgo, where they can experience firsthand the timeless beauty of the oldest tree on Earth.</p><p>A renowned botanist recounts the eventful 250-million-year history of the ginkgo tree, its near demise during the ice ages, its surprising reprieve from extinction through human intervention, and its honored place in cities around the globe.<b>Peter Crane </b>is Carl W.

Author, Dan McAdams, organizes the field according to a broad conceptual perspective that has emerged in personality psychology over the past 10 years. According to this perspective, personality is made up of three levels of psychological individuality - dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations (such as motives and goals), and integrative life stories. Traits, adaptations, and stories comprise the three most recognizable variations on psychological human nature, grounded in the human evolutionary heritage and situated in cultural and historical context. The <i>fifth edition</i> of this beautifully written text expands and updates research on the neuroscience of personality traits and introduces new material on personality disorders, evolution and religion, attachment in adulthood, continuity and change in personality over the life course, and the development of narrative identity.</p><p><b>Experience the story of a lifetime</b> <p>When you want to truly get to know a person, dates and facts about their life will only tell you so much.

In <i>The Person: An Integrated Introduction to Personality Psychology, Fourth Edition,</i> Dan McAdams presents a bold and integrative vision for personality psychology that puts many different ideas into a meaningful structure. With this text, you can understand the larger story, and discover how powerful and useful studying personality psychology is today.</p> <p>The text begins with fundamental evolutionary, social, and cultural contexts for understanding personality, followed by an examination of the three different levels of an individual&#x2019;s personality:</p> <p>- <i>Dispositional traits</i>, a person&#x2019;s general tendencies.</p> <p>- <i>Characteristic adaptations</i>, a person&#x2019;s desires, beliefs, concerns, and coping mechanisms.</p> <p>- <i>Life stories</i>, the stories that give a life a sense of unity, meaning, and purpose.</p> <p><b>Key Features</b>:</p> <ul> <li>New streamlined paperback format.</li> <li>Updated with recent research findings to engage professors and students alike.</li> <li>Presents a clear unifying vision for the field of personality psychology.</li> <li>Brings together the best from traditional personality theories and contemporary research.</li> <li>Addresses the most important questions that people can ask about their own lives and about human life in general.</li> </ul><b>Dan P.

A graduate of Oxford University, he served as a law clerk to a Supreme Court justice, is now an adviser to several museums and foundations, and, when not writing in coffee shops around New York City, continues to practice criminal litigation. He is the author of Pasquale&#x2019;s Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town. He lives at the Chelsea Hotel with his wife and daughter.THE WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT<br><br>1.<br><br>A woman set a coffee before me, and I thought of the first time that I saw a woman fly.<br><br>2.<br><br>Among quiet neighbors, we were the quietest. Father came home every day at the same time, greeted my mother, settled on the couch, and slept; occasionally he would sit in a chair. In either case he would sleep.<br> At six-thirty he would be called to dinner. After dinner he would return to the couch. Mother would sit next to him. When he finished reading, he would go to his room and sleep.<br> My father was the appreciative product of his own privileged life. Born in Nebraska, he was Republican, affluent, and content.<br> As to his relationship with my mother, I heard not a single argument between them. They were respectful and admiring.<br><br>3.<br><br>Mother was sitting on the steps in the hall. In front of her was a box of letters. She pointed to a room in the back. There in tandem on the bureau were his belongings. This was the purpose of my return to remove what I cared to have. My father had died several years before, and Mother was moving.<br> But the objects in that room gave oï¿½ no trace of my father. He fit so smoothly into the order of things, the circuitus spiritualis, that he had passed on nothing that was not more perfectly expressed by something nearby; if he had an emotion or thought that was individual to him, it lacked the power of emanation.<br> I gathered the few things of his and my own that I had decided to take back to New York. Needing a box, my wife, Sheila, and I went into the basement.<br> After a few minutes, I found a small container and then retraced my steps.<br> Sheila asked me about a black portfolio that had been slipped behind a cabinet. She pulled it out and laid it on the floor; the portfolio was held together with black ribbons.<br> An arm, a leg, a torso, another arm, a torso, a head came out of the portfolio. A naked black woman.<br> Sheets and sheets of a naked black woman, and below each the initials of my father.<br> On the other side of the basement wall was a small room used to develop black-and-white photographs. Scribbled on the wall of that room was this:<br><br> They do not sweat and whine about their condition, They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sin, They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God, Not one is dissatisfied. . . .&#x201d; Whitman.<br><br>Mother was preparing dinner. For as long as I could remember my family had a cook. The ablest was Mary. But even the worst were capable of being taught, and my mother did a very good job of that. They were different from the meals I would get at our neighbors&#x2019;.<br> Claire was one of our neighbors and I enjoyed visiting her. One evening at Claire&#x2019;s, we heard her brother, Ronald, singing Surrey with the Fringe on Top&#x201d; from the musical Oklahoma! That was unusual because Ronald had for years sat quietly in his room. I imagined that he was writing or composing or juggling and that one day I would hear that he had won a prize.<br> Claire went straight to his room. She wanted to share in his happiness.<br> What she saw was a happy Ronald lying on his back rotating a live chicken on his manliness, singing Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry when I take you out in the surrey. . . .&#x201d; We made our way back to Claire&#x2019;s room. Minutes later Ronald passed the door.<br> He was upset.<br> Recounting her last minutes, he explained that in enjoying a chicken the greatest pleasure comes when the chicken&#x2019;s neck is broken, causing a death shiver&#x201d; that Ronald found impossible to duplicate&#x201d; suggesting that Ronald had only settled on chickens after experimenting with other animals.<br> Several days later, I found myself back at Claire&#x2019;s. It was the late afternoon and Ronald&#x2019;s mother had returned to the house with a friend who was visiting Omaha from the East Coast. Claire&#x2019;s mother invited me to join the family for dinner.<br> When Claire and I came to the table, everyone was there but Ronald. He was still in his room.<br> Claire&#x2019;s mother brought out a delicious first course. Before we had finished it, Ronald arrived. His mood was good.<br> Having cleared the table, Claire&#x2019;s mother returned from the kitchen with the tetrazzini. Then I saw it. Ronald&#x2019;s face rippled. There was only one conclusion: we were about to eat his lover.<br> As I reflected on this, the woman from the East Coast, who was sitting to my left, placed a good-sized portion of tetrazzini on her plate. Believing that one is obligated to warn one&#x2019;s dinner companion that she is about to consume a dish that has been inseminated by another guest at the table, I leaned toward the lady from the East Coast and whispered, The chicken was murdered.&#x201d; There was no response.<br> With Ronald&#x2019;s lover nnow inside her mouth, I bent down, pretending to have dropped my napkin, and turning my head upwards from next to her knee, whispered, There&#x2019;s semen in the chicken.&#x201d; That did iiiiit.<br> In retrospect it has occurred to me that I&#x2019;d simply substituted an obvious observation with an obvious and repulsive observation, and the woman&#x2019;s inability to finish her meal had less to do with the chicken than with me. Ronald had succeeded in making me more revolting than Ronald himself.<br> I would like to say that Ronald was now in the musical theater, but the truth is that I do not know what happened to Ronald.<br><br>We left Omaha on a Sunday. On the way to the airport, we passed the Civic Auditorium. It is where I saw the woman (Miss Rietta) fly.<br><br>4.<br><br>In New York, I went back to sitting in a coffee shop on Ninth Avenue.<br> A blond woman approached my table. She was from the seminary. She was a friend of the Bearded Priest and asked me if I&#x2019;d seen him. She was concerned.<br> Before becoming the Bearded Priest, he had raised bird dogs and before that worked in a lumberyard. As an Episcopalian priest, he had lived among the spiritists of Haiti and now spent his time reading Emmanuel Levinas and fishing oï¿½ a pier on Fourteenth Street. I had taken note of him because of his resemblance to Whitman and because of Levinas.<br> A Lithuanian Jew who had moved to Germany in the late 1920s, Levinas attended Husserl&#x2019;s last semester of teaching and Heidegger&#x2019;s first. Levinas&#x2019;s translation of Husserl&#x2019;s Cartesian Meditations brought phenomenology to the French and specifically to Sartre. During the war, Levinas was taken prisoner by the Germans and placed in a concentration camp.<br> Levinas survived the war. His family did not. It was at this time that Levinas was introduced to the Talmud, and it was to the Talmud that he devoted much of his writing.<br> I told the woman that I&#x2019;d not seen the Bearded Priest.<br> She sat down. She was attractively built, her face was a deep pale, her eyes soft and alarmed. We began to speak. She told me that she had been brought to the priesthood by accident, a chance reading of the story of Saul.<br> My father had told me this story.<br> He was not known for talking. Even to his sons he spoke little. But this story he had told me, this story among a handful of others, randomly offered and separated by long stretches of time. Some of these stories I remembered, some I did not. Some of my father I remembered; some I did not.<br> I asked the woman from the seminary to retell the story. She did and as she did the late afternoon light withdrew and all was quiet.<br> The story of Saul is found in the first book of Samuel.<br> It begins with the elders of Israel approaching the aging prophet Samuel with the request that he name a king. The Israelites, weak and under siege, were concerned that when Samuel died, they would be left without a leader. Samuel put the request to the Lord.<br> The Lord warned the Israelites against a king.<br> The Israelites insisted.<br> Granting their request, the Lord chose Saul, a modest young man from the smallest clan of the smallest tribe.<br> Saul immediately proved himself, leading the Israelites to victory over their enemies. Before his battle with the Amalekites, Saul had received a specific instruction from God: the Amalekites were to be entirely destroyed,&#x201d; including the women and children and cattle.<br> But Saul did not listen to the Lord. Having defeated the Amalekites, he spared the life of the Amalekite king, Agag, and the best of the Amalekites&#x2019; animals.<br> When Samuel discovered what Saul had done, Samuel scolded Saul. Saul returned that Agag was in the custody of the Israelites and that the animals were to be used as sacrificial offerings to God. Samuel cut Saul short: Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the Lord?&#x201d; Leaving no doubt as to where he stood on the matter, Samuel had Agag dragged out and executed.<br> Displeased with Saul, God sent an Evil Spirit to torment him. At the same time, God instructed Samuel to summon David, whom God had selected as the next king of Israel. Jealous of David ( Saul has his thousand, David his ten thousand&#x201d;) and tormented by the Evil Spirit, Saul attempted to slay David. While David was in bed with his wife, Saul&#x2019;s men entered David&#x2019;s house. David&#x2019;s wife urged David to escape, replacing David in the bed with a teraph topped with goat&#x2019;s hair. The substitution allowed David the time to flee.<br> The story ends with Saul leading the Israelites in battle against the Philistines. As the battle neared, Saul, desperate to know whether the Israelites would prevail, found himself cut oï¿½ from the voices that could assist him: Samuel was dead, Saul&#x2019;s dreams revealed nothing, and there was a standing interdiction (issued by Saul himself) against seers. Defying his own decree, he approached the Witch of Endor.<br> Saul&#x2019;s plan was to have the Witch find Samuel and bring him back to the living. Saul would then consult Samuel on the battle with the Philistines.<br> When the Witch recognized Saul, Saul promised the Witch that she would not be punished for violating the law against necromancy. So assured, the Witch retrieved Samuel from the dead.<br> Samuel began by chastising Saul for past offenses. As to the battle with the Philistines, Samuel informed Saul that neither he nor his sons would survive. The next day, Saul, surrounded by the Philistines, impaled himself on his sword. The Philistines removed Saul&#x2019;s head.<br><br>At the point in the story when Saul approached the Witch of Endor, the voice of the woman in the cafï¿½ was no longer the voice of the woman in the cafï¿½. My father was finishing the story and by the time he had finished the story, I knew that I would be leaving New York and returning to Omaha. I would find the black woman in the picture and through her find my father. I would retrieve him from the dead.<br><br>5.<br><br>In Omaha, I phoned detectives. After talking to three or four, I set up an appointment with Frank Williams. Williams, according to the other detectives, had ways of getting information that no one else had.<br> To meet Williams, I traversed the part of Omaha that had been built since the war the shopping malls, the strip malls, the stores the size of malls, the car lots, the fast-food restaurants, all close to the earth, close to its color emerging upon that neighborhood that is older, blacker, and lighter. I stood, finally, outside a locked bar. From a surveillance camera mounted near the door, Williams watched me.<br> The door opened.<br> The interior was dark. The door was locked behind me.<br> A black man led me to a stool in the empty bar. He poured me a drink.<br> I explained why I was there.<br> Williams asked me to follow him. He took me to a place where we could speak without being overheard.<br> In the basement of the bar was a room with three tables. Passing through that room, Williams removed a set of keys and unlocked a door. On the other side of the door were a desk and a series of monitors.<br> After reviewing the monitors, all of which were trained on the empty parking lot, he questioned me.<br> Have you talked to anyone about this?&#x201d; A few.<br> What do they know?&#x201d; Nothing.<br> Did your father have a best friend?&#x201d; Yes.<br> Have you talked to him?&#x201d; No. He is sick and recognizes no one, including himself. He&#x2019;s in no position to help.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll be the judge of that.&#x201d; Williams checked the surveillance monitors.<br> He&#x2019;s completely unconscious,&#x201d; I insisted.<br> Not so fast!&#x201d; Not so fast?&#x201d; Have you heard of the brain machine?&#x201d; No.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve used it to solve many cases.&#x201d; A brain machine?&#x201d; The machine is in Iowa. It goes into your brain and reads thoughts you didn&#x2019;t know were there. You can&#x2019;t lie to it, can&#x2019;t fool it; and once you&#x2019;ve answered it, you can&#x2019;t undo it.&#x201d; Williams checked his watch.<br> Come back at three and don&#x2019;t eat.&#x201d;<br><br>When I returned to the bar, I picked up Reggie, a friend who had experience with detectives.<br> Williams had been to a funeral and was in a good mood.<br> Wait for me downstairs.&#x201d; Reggie and I sat at one of the tables outside Williams&#x2019;s office.<br> Williams appeared at our table.<br> As he sat down, a door opened at the other end of the room and a naked woman walked out. She was followed by another woman. Also naked. And then another. There were six women in all all black and all naked.<br> After a brief discussion among the women, one began to move around the room. She was five foot five or six and weighed three hundred pounds.<br> At the center of the room, she stood still for several minutes as if readying herself for an oration. Then, suddenly, she flipped herself upside down. As she balanced on her head, two men strode from the shadows. One took a position on her left, the other on her right. Bending forward, they stared fixedly into the fullness of her womanhood.<br> Williams, who had disappeared, arrived at our table with a platter of food.<br> We were joined by the naked women. We all began to eat.<br> Perhaps this was Williams&#x2019;s idea of a lineup, not having realized that the woman I was looking for would be in her seventies. On the other hand, he may have thought that I was the one looking for a black woman and that the story about my father was a coded request. Or this may just be what Williams did in the afternoon.<br> As we drove from the bar, Reggie offered this: Williams knows the woman. He&#x2019;s got upside-down women, he&#x2019;s got brain machines and trays of food everything but the person you&#x2019;re looking for, and the reason he doesn&#x2019;t have her and doesn&#x2019;t ask you any questions about her is that he knows who she is. Williams knows everything about your dad and his woman and he&#x2019;s protecting them.&#x201d; And what,&#x201d; I asked, do you think he knows?&#x201d; Easy. Your dad was taking the women from his factory to his office and painting them; they went along with it because he was paying for it or he was having sex with them or he was paying them and having sex. He got the factory from his folks and decided to fill it with colored women who looked good with their clothes oï¿½. It was part plantation, part art studio.&#x201d; A demented Schindler?&#x201d; They go along with it because he&#x2019;s the boss or because they like him or feel sorry for him. Finally he falls in love with one of them. She becomes his woman, and he can&#x2019;t bear the idea of throwing out her portrait.&#x201d; If Reggie was right and my father was painting his mistress, then he was a man that I did not know, for I had never seen him with another woman, never heard rumor of such, and from everything that I knew he was devoted, throughout his marriage, to my mother.<br> But if the woman in the painting was his mistress and was still out there, I would find her. And when I found her, I would find her children, my half brothers and sisters. There would be the distasteful surprise, denials, hostility, but soon all would turn awakening, reconciliation, friendships would follow. I readied myself.<br><br>Down the street from the hotel where I lived in New York was a large advertising agency.

In this illustrated study, Suzanne Hudson presents the painting as the work of an artist who was also a thinker, poet, and writer for whom self-presentation was a necessary part of making her works public. With <i> Night Sea</i>, Hudson argues, Martin (1912&#x2013;2004) created a shimmering realization of control and loss that stands alone within her suite of classic grid paintings as an exemplary and exceptional achievement.</p><p>Hudson offers a close examination of <i>Night Sea </i>and its position within Martin's long and prolific career, during which the artist destroyed many works as she sought forms of perfection within self-imposed restrictions of color and line. For Hudson, <i> Night Sea</i> stands as the last of Martin's process-based works before she turned from oil to acrylic and sought to express emotions of lightness and purity unburdened by evidence of human struggle.</p><p>Drawing from a range of archival records, Hudson attempts to draw together the facts surrounding the work, which were at times obfuscated by the artist's desire for privacy. Critical responses of the time give a sense of the impact of the work and that which followed it. Texts by peers including Lenore Tawney, Donald Judd, and Lucy Lippard are presented alongside interviews with a number of Martin's friends and keepers of estates, such as the publisher Ronald Feldman and Kathleen Mangan of the Lenore Tawney archive, which holds correspondence between Martin and Tawney.</p></p><p>Suzanne Hudson is Associate Professor of Art History and Fine Art at the University of Southern California. She is the author of <i>Robert Ryman: Used Paint </i>(MIT Press) and <i>Painting Now</i>.<p>In&nbsp;her wonderful contribution to the Afterall Books One Work series,&nbsp;Suzanne&nbsp;Hudson persuasively argues that Agnes Martin's 1963 painting&nbsp;Night Sea&nbsp;is the&nbsp;summa of the early grid paintings. Because, as Hudson shows,&nbsp;Night Sea&nbsp;makes&nbsp;Martin's process&#x2015;and indeed Martin's struggle&#x2015;so&nbsp;visible, we comprehend much&nbsp;more clearly what follows: the achieved&nbsp;perfection of the graphite grid paintings.&nbsp;That an analysis of a single&nbsp;work could so fully illuminate the entirety of&nbsp;an artist's&nbsp;oeuvre is a true accomplishment. Plus, the prose is a&nbsp;pleasure to read.</p> (Douglas Crimp, Fanny Knapp Allen Professor of Art History at the University of Rochester)</p><h2>America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s-1920s</h2><p>The Progressive Era, from the 1890s to the 1920s, was one of the most important periods in American social, political, and economic history. During this time, the United States saw a great change in the role of government, particularly in terms of its involvement in the regulation of business and industry. This era has often been characterized as the first period in which government power was increased for largely egalitarian reasons; however, many have argued the opposite case--that the legislation was designed by industry to serve its own purposes. <br> In <em>America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s-1920s</em>, author Maureen A. Flanagan introduces progressivism less as a straightforward history of actual reforms than as a revision of the ways in which Americans organized themselves to confront the problems of their society. She examines how this reorganization in turn drew Americans into a new type of relationship with the federal government. Drawing on the most up-to-date scholarship, Flanagan explores what democracy meant to various citizens and emphasizes the "social justice" movement as an integral aspect of progressive reforms. Organized around four thematic lines of progressivism--political, social justice, economic, and foreign policy--the book analyzes the various ideas, actors, and movements that constituted the timeperiod. By incorporating coverage of how women, African Americans, and ethnic and working-class organizations participated in progressive reform movements, Flanagan reveals how the reform struggles of the period all revolved around defining the nature and purpose of U.S. democracy. Ideal for undergraduate courses in the U.S. Progressive Era and the Gilded Age/Progressive Era, <em>America Reformed</em> features documents, maps, and illustrations throughout, as well as anecdotes of historical events to introduce each chapter. The text also includes references to scholarly websites of original source material.<br></p><p>Maureen Flanagan is a Professor of History at Michigan State University.<br>"Maureen Flanagan...has, with this book, continued to pioneer in the field. Indeed, Flanagan's <em>American Reformed</em> has, in the five years since its publication, become the standard textbook for the period...merican Reformed serves as an excellent intellectual reflection of the field; it will also surely continue to serve as an important shaper of future scholarly discourse." --<em>The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Nationalism and Modernism</h2><p>The first major study in over three decades to explore the essential arguments of all the major theoretical interpretations of nationalism, from the modernist approaches of Gellner, Nairn, Breuilly, Giddens and Hobsbawm to the alternative paradigms of van den Bergh and Geertz, Armstrong and Smith himself. <br> In a style accessible to the student and the general reader Smith traces the changing view of this hotly discussed topic within the current political, cultural and socioeconomic arena. He also analyses the contributions of such historians, sociologists and political scientists as Seton-Watson, Reynolds, Hastings, Horowitz and Brass. The survey concludes with an analysis of post-modern approaches to national identity, gender and nation, making it indispensable reading to all those interested in gaining full and authoritative knowledge of nationalism.</p><p><strong>'a unique scholarly overview of a vast topic.'</strong> - <em>Earthwatch</em></p><h2>Student Solutions Manual for Wackerly/Mendenhall/Scheaffer&#x2019;s Mathematical Statistics with Applications, 6th</h2><p>Worked-out solutions to odd-numbered exercises.</p><p>Richard L.

James O&#39;Shaughnessy, author of the highly-acclaimed Invest Like the Best, analyzes 30 years worth of CompuStat stock market data to show how the 15 most popular investment strategies have actually performed over time. With What Works on Wall Street, investors of all stripes-from the most conservative to the most aggressive-will finally have the facts to pick the best strategies for meeting their investment objectives.</p><p>Investors -- be they aggressive or conservative, self-directed or professionally managed -- are always on the lookout for an edge. And in James O'Shaughnessy's <b>What Works on Wall Street: A Guide to the Best-Performing Investment Strategies of All Time</b>, they'll find a solid one: authoritative analysis of popular practices from the past. The author examines three decades of stock market data to show how 15 of the most common investment tactics have fared over time.<i>What Works on Wall Street</i> was probably the most anticipated investment book of 1996. James O'Shaughnessy gained unprecedented access to Standard &amp; Poor's Compustat database and back-tested the returns generated by various clearly defined investment approaches over the past 40 years. The book challenges quite a bit of the conventional wisdom about portfolio management and is a compelling, although statistically flawed, work. <p> In <i>What Works on Wall Street</i>, O'Shaughnessy examines the performance of the highest and lowest price/earnings, price/sales, price/book value, relative strength, yield and earnings growth stocks over various periods, trying to find which types of companies tended to perform best. Although you can quibble with a lot of the data, the sheer magnitude of the task O'Shaughnessy has undertaken is impressive. His final, multifactor strategies that generated the best investments over time are very interesting, particularly the Cornerstone Value approach, which is very similar to the Dow Dividend Approach with a few other bells and whistles. </p><p> O'Shaughnessy's book and its findings should be read, discussed and disputed by all investors. However much one can criticize the work for being too focused on the plight of professional money managers looking to pick fifty stocks and not individual investors looking to pick five, the information is valuable and compelling. The only warning that I would give to readers is to be aware of a methodological error in the way O'Shaughnessy does the statistics. Because of the time required, O'Shaughnessy and his team looked at how the 50 highest or lowest stocks in any particular group performed. Extrapolating the performance of extreme data points to the entire set of data being studied is not entirely correct, as there are many processes in nature where the middle actually does not act like the extremes. Mass and velocity in physics are one example, where super-light and super-dense objects both do not obey the laws of physics, while everything in between does. With this caveat, I think an investor can learn a lot from the book.</p></p><h2>Milady&#39;s Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary</h2><p>The second edition of this thorough reference is an invaluable tool for assessing cosmetic products, addressing both the quality of the product and the effect it has on the skin. Since a product&#39;s ultimate purpose is to benefit the skin, it is crucial to have an understanding of how the skin works, how and why a product may or may not penetrate it, and what care individual skin types and conditions may require. It is difficult to discuss product ingredients without correlating product performance to skin function. An expanded section on skin physiology and chemical concepts enables the reader to better understand product performance through a thorough explanation of how chemicals and ingredients interact. The various skin types, conditions, and appropriate ingredients for treatments provide a quick reference to address clients&#39; needs. This enlarged second edition contains over 2,000 ingredients including 200 new and updated entries. Expanded information on antioxidants and their stability, new discussion on aging and sensitive skin, and function of SPF and new sunblock ingredients offering full spectrum sunscreen and sunblock for both UVA and UVB rays has been added. A complete glossary of terms found in the skin physiology section familiarizes readers with the terminology used by chemists, and an appendix cross-referencing Latin botanical names with commonly used names complete this reference.</p><p>Natalia Michalun was an international dermo-cosmetic expert and educator.

Each chapter focuses on a domain of development such as physical growth, cognition, or personality, and traces developmental trends and influences in that domain from infancy to old age. Within each chapter, you will find sections on four life stages: infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. This unique organization enables students to comprehend the processes of transformation that occur in key areas of human development. Another staple of the text is its emphasis on theories and how they apply to specific topics in each chapter. This new edition also asks students to engage more actively with the content, and includes a clear focus on the complex interactions of nature and nurture in development, more integrated coverage of culture and diversity, and an exciting new media package for both students and instructors.</p><p>Carol K.

Well-known for her reclusive personal life in Amherst, Massachusetts , her distinctively short lines, and eccentric approach to punctuation and capitalization, she completed over seventeen hundred poems in her short life.

Jackall reveals a world where hard work does <em>not</em> necessarily lead to success, but where sharp talk, self-promotion, powerful patrons, and sheer luck might. Cheerfully-bland public faces mask intense competition in this world where people hide their intentions, and accountability often depends on the ability to outrun mistakes. <br> In this topsy-turvy world, managers must bring often unforgiving technology and always difficult people together to make money, an uncompromising task demanding continual compromises with conventional truths. Moral questions become merely practical concerns and issues of public relations. Sooner or later, managers find themselves wondering how to act in such a world and still maintain a sense of personal integrity. <br> This brilliant, sometimes disturbing, often wildly funny study of corporate thinking, decision-making, and morality presents compelling real life stories of the men and women charged with running the businesses of America. It will interest anyone concerned with how big organizations actually function, or with the current moral malaise in our public life.</p><p><br><strong>Robert Jackall</strong> is Professor of Sociology and Chairman of the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams College.

Most of us would cite matzo balls, gefilte fish, and other Eastern European-born fare. But there's a second Jewish food tradition--the cuisine of the Mediterranean Sephardim. Author Joyce Goldstein first encountered it in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Dishes such as Poached Fish with Walnut Sauce, Roast Chicken with Apples and Pomegranate, and Saffron Rice Pudding exemplify this delectable legacy. Part investigation of Sephardic cooking--of the migrations and religious directives that gave it life--and part paean to its bright, tantalizing flavors, Goldstein's cookbook should prove a revelation to all cooks, Jewish or not.<p> Starting with a history of the Spanish and Portuguese (Sephardic) diasporas that brought Jews to the Mediterranean, Goldstein then provides information on kosher law and a discussion of American Sephardim, among other relevant topics. Standouts among the recipes that follow include Fish with Rhubarb Sauce, Lamb with Green Garlic, and Meat Loaf with Sweet and Sour Tomato Sauce. The book's chapters on savory pastries and vegetables and grains are particularly noteworthy, and include such tantalizing recipes as Cheese-Stuffed Peppers and Pumpkin-Filled Filo Roses. With photographs of many of the dishes, suggestions for Sephardic holiday meals, and a wealth of anecdotes and lore throughout, the book uncovers an unexplored Jewish cuisine now available to all. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>In Sephardic Flavors, celebrated chef Joyce Goldstein uncovers the culinary history of the Diaspora, tracing through ingredients and culinary techniques how the Sephardic Jews adapted the cuisines of their new homelands.

In the West, it&#x2019;s usually associated with various kinds of absolute idealism in the West, or mystical traditions in the East&#x2014;and as a result, many modern&nbsp;philosophers are poorly informed on the topic. Increasingly, however, nonduality is finding its way into Western philosophical debates. In this &#x201c;scholarly but leisurely and very readable&#x201d; (<i>Spectrum Review</i>) analysis of the philosophies of nondualism of (Hindu) Vedanta, Mahayana Buddhism, and Taoism, renowned thinker David R.

His performances in the 1970s redefined the possibilities of the medium; his subsequent sculpture and installations have sought to extend the limits of the physical and explore the psychological impact on the individual of actions and objects in the world. This book, the first substantial monograph on Burden in twenty years, gives a complete overview of his art, illuminated by searching texts by some of the most important curators and writers on art today and supported by a complete catalogue. Edited in close collaboration with the artist, its thematic arrangement reveals the conceptual relationships between works produced in widely differing mediums.

Robinson offers a theory of globalization that follows the rise of a new capitalist class and a transnational state. Growing beyond national boundaries, this new class comprises a global system in which Japanese capitalists are just as comfortable investing in Latin America as North Americans are in Southeast Asia. Their development of global, interconnected industries and businesses make them drivers of world capitalism.</p><p>Robinson explains how global capital mobility has allowed capital to reorganize production worldwide in accordance with a whole range of considerations that allow for maximizing profit making opportunities. As a result, production systems that were once located in a single country have been fragmented and integrated externally into new globalized circuits of accumulation. What this means, however, is not simply that factories are located overseas where labor might be cheaper, but rather that the whole production process is broken down into smaller parts and each of those parts moved to a different country, depending on where investment might be highest. Yet at the same time, this worldwide decentralization and fragmentation of the production process has taken place alongside the centralization of command and control of the global economy in transnational capital.</p><p>In turn, this economic organization finds a political counterpart in the rise of a transnational state. The leaders of global businesses and industries think about themselves and how they live in new ways. Hegemony in the twenty-first century, Robinson argues, will be exercised not by a particular nation-state but by this new global ruling class through the machinery of this transnational state. Robinson observes, for example, that global elites, regardless of their nationality, increasingly tend to share similar lifestyles and interact through expanding networks of the transnational state. Globalization is in this way unifying the world into a single mode of production and a single global system and bringing about the integration of different countries and regions into a new global economy and society. But the new global capitalism is rife with contradictions, such as the growing rift between the global rich and the global poor, concludes Robinson. The twenty-first century is likely to harbor ongoing conflicts and disputes for control between the new transnational ruling group and the expanding ranks of the poor and the marginalized. Sure to stir controversy and debate, <i>A Theory of Global Capitalism</i> will be of interest to sociologists and economists alike.</p></p><p><p><b>William I.

It is a strange story, in which many extraordinary things happen, some of them shocking and brutal, some of them pitiful and touching--yet always with elements of comedy and irony and burlesque that appear in unexpected places. It is a book that has a great deal to say and which is destined to have a great deal said about it.<br><br>After a brief prologue, the story begins with a terrifying experience of the hero's high school days, moves quickly to the campus of a Southern Negro college and then to New York's Harlem, where most of the action takes place. The many people that the hero meets in the course of his wanderings are remarkably various, complex and significant. With them he becomes involved in an amazing series of adventures, in which he is sometimes befriended but more often deceived and betrayed--as much by himself and his own illusions as by the duplicity of the blindness of others. <br><br><b>Invisible Man </b>is not only a great triumph of storytelling and characterization; it is a profound and uncompromising interpretation of the Negro's anomalous position in American society.</p><p>We rely, in this world, on the visual aspects of humanity as a means of learning who we are. This, Ralph Ellison argues convincingly, is a dangerous habit. A classic from the moment it first appeared in 1952, <i>Invisible Man</i> chronicles the travels of its narrator, a young, nameless black man, as he moves through the hellish levels of American intolerance and cultural blindness. Searching for a context in which to know himself, he exists in a very peculiar state. "I am an invisible man," he says in his prologue. "When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination--indeed, everything and anything except me." But this is hard-won self-knowledge, earned over the course of many years.<p> As the book gets started, the narrator is expelled from his Southern Negro college for inadvertently showing a white trustee the reality of black life in the south, including an incestuous farmer and a rural whorehouse. The college director chastises him: "Why, the dumbest black bastard in the cotton patch knows that the only way to please a white man is to tell him a lie! What kind of an education are you getting around here?" Mystified, the narrator moves north to New York City, where the truth, at least as he perceives it, is dealt another blow when he learns that his former headmaster's recommendation letters are, in fact, letters of condemnation. </p><p> What ensues is a search for what truth actually is, which proves to be supremely elusive. The narrator becomes a spokesman for a mixed-race band of social activists called "The Brotherhood" and believes he is fighting for equality. Once again, he realizes he's been duped into believing what he thought was the truth, when in fact it is only another variation. Of the Brothers, he eventually discerns: "They were blind, bat blind, moving only by the echoed sounds of their voices. And because they were blind they would destroy themselves.... Here I thought they accepted me because they felt that color made no difference, when in reality it made no difference because they didn't see either color or men."</p><p> <i>Invisible Man</i> is certainly a book about race in America, and sadly enough, few of the problems it chronicles have disappeared even now. But Ellison's first novel transcends such a narrow definition. It's also a book about the human race stumbling down the path to identity, challenged and successful to varying degrees. None of us can ever be sure of the truth beyond ourselves, and possibly not even there. The world is a tricky place, and no one knows this better than the invisible man, who leaves us with these chilling, provocative words: "And it is this which frightens me: Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?" <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>"The Negro American experience...is indispensable to any profoundly American depiction of reality...This background provides the black writer with much to write about. As fictional material it rivals that of the nineteenth-century Russians."<br>--Ralph Ellison</p><h2>Assyria to Iberia: Art and Culture in the Iron Age: The Metropolitan Museum of Art Symposia</h2><p>In 2014, the Metropolitan Museum presented <i>Assyria to Iberia at the Dawn of the Classical Age</i>, an unprecedented exhibition that offered a comprehensive overview of art, diplomacy, and cultural exchange in the ancient Near East and across the Mediterranean at the beginning of what is now known as the classical age.

He reveals the interactions between politics, society and ideas that contributed to the problems and changes of this period.</p> <p>The book addresses the crises of the medieval world. At the start of the period, Europe was dominated by the institutions of the church, monarchy, armies of knightly cavalry and Gothic art. By the end, the Papacy had been drastically weakened, the Hussite movement was heralding the social and religious changes to come in the next century, the armoured knight was no longer a formidable force, and the cultural movement of the Italian Renaissance was beginning to unfold. The author shows how economic forces, including the Black Death and the fall in population threatened the power of the landowners, church and monarchy and how such changes prompted interaction not only between political powers but between different communities and divergent ways of life and thought.</p> <p><br> Throughout the book, Professor Holmes relates his strong political narrative to the social and ideological movements of the period and explains the legacy of this period for the centuries that followed.

One of the earliest novels to explicitly portray homosexuality, the influence of Djuna Barnes's novel has been, and continues to be, exceptional.</p><p><i>Nightwood</i> is not only a classic of modernist literature, but was also acknowledged by T. S. Eliot as one of the great novels of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><i>Nightwood</i> is not only a classic of lesbian literature, but was also acknowledged by no less than T. S. Eliot as one of the great novels of the 20th century. Eliot admired Djuna Barnes' rich, evocative language. Lesbian readers will admire the exquisite craftsmanship and Barnes' penetrating insights into obsessive passion. Barnes told a friend that <i>Nightwood</i> was written with her own blood "while it was still running." That flowing wound was the breakup of an eight-year relationship with the lesbian love of her life.Admired by T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Graham Greene, and Dylan Thomas, Djuna Barnes was the most influential and prolific female writer in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s. The Modern Library is proud to include--for the first time--her most critically acclaimed novel, <b>Nightwood</b>, which was praised by The Washington Post Book World as "a masterpiece of modernism." Dorothy Allison, author of the National Book Award-nominated novel <i>Bastard Out of Carolina</i>, has written an Introduction especially for this edition, in which she defends <b>Nightwood</b> as a lesbian classic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>First published in the United States in 1937, <b>Nightwood</b> is a novel of bold imagining and passionate, lyrical prose. Described by the author as the soliloquy of "a soul talking to itself in the heart of the night," the novel creates a dreamlike world in which time ceases to exist and in which human beings transform into animals. At Nightwood's center are the love affairs of Robin Vote--a character based on Barnes's lover, Thelma Wood. Robin marries Felix Volkbein, an eccentric aristocrat, whom she meets in Paris, and whom she abandons years later for the American Nora Flood. But Nora cannot contain Robin, either, and Robin in turn deserts her for the larcenous Jenny Petherbridge. Rich in irony and symbolism, Nightwood brilliantly depicts the all-consuming power of erotic obsession in language that twists and turns, drawing the reader into a labyrinth of meaning and revelation. This edition also includes T. S. Eliot's Introduction to the 1937 American edition.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Elizabeth Hardwick wrote, "Djuna Barnes is a writer of wild and original gifts. . . .To her name there is always to be attached the splendor of <b>Nightwood</b>, a lasting achievement of her great gifts and eccentricities---her passionate prose and, in this case, a genuineness of human passions."</p><h2>The Oxford Picture Dictionary for the Content Areas (Monolingual English Edition)</h2><p>Designed for students who are learning English, the monolingual version of the Dictionary presents over 1500 words drawn from content areas of social studies, history, science, and math.

This beautifully illustrated book opens in the middle of the nineteenth century when ornithology was a museum-based discipline focused almost exclusively on the anatomy, taxonomy, and classification of dead birds. It describes how in the early 1900s pioneering individuals such as Erwin Stresemann, Ernst Mayr, and Julian Huxley recognized the importance of studying live birds in the field, and how this shift thrust ornithology into the mainstream of the biological sciences. The book tells the stories of eccentrics like Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, a pathological liar who stole specimens from museums and quite likely murdered his wife, and describes the breathtaking insights and discoveries of ambitious and influential figures such as David Lack, Niko Tinbergen, Robert MacArthur, and others who through their studies of birds transformed entire fields of biology.</p><p><i>Ten Thousand Birds</i> brings this history vividly to life through the work and achievements of those who advanced the field. Drawing on a wealth of archival material and in-depth interviews, this fascinating book reveals how research on birds has contributed more to our understanding of animal biology than the study of just about any other group of organisms.</p></p><p><p>"A first-class review not only of the recent history of ornithology but also of the key players involved. No other book of this type comes anywhere near this one in its breadth of coverage and depth of scholarship. <i>Ten Thousand Birds</i> is in a class by itself, and an outstanding read."<b>--Ian Newton, author of <i>The Migration Ecology of Birds</i></b></p><p>"This book fills an important and neglected niche. The mix of science, history, personality, and human interest is unique and one that people will find highly appealing. I found the prose not only engaging but downright riveting."<b>--Walt Koenig, coeditor of <i>Ecology and Evolution of Cooperative Breeding in Birds</i></b></p><p>"This is a hugely impressive book that synthesizes an enormous amount of information in a very accessible and engaging way, and makes an original contribution not only to the history of modern ornithology but also to the general history of biological science since Darwin. It will be an invaluable reference for general readers and students, and offers specialists a paradigmatic case study of the scientific method in action."<b>--Jeremy Mynott, author of <i>Birdscapes: Birds in Our Imagination and Experience</i></b></p><p>"This brilliant, wide-ranging book examines the debates, mistakes, and major conceptual breakthroughs that advanced our knowledge of avian biology. It documents how science proceeds, and skillfully humanizes it. <i>Ten Thousand Birds</i> is not only the best modern treatise on the history of ornithology. It is also a powerful summary of the remarkable biology of birds and what we still don't know. This book is not just for ornithologists or serious birders."<b>--Frank Gill, author of <i>Ornithology</i></b></p><b>Tim Birkhead</b> is professor of zoology at the University of Sheffield, where he teaches and conducts research on the behavioral ecology of birds with particular focus on reproduction.

It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction.Charlotte Bronte's impassioned novel is the love story of Jane Eyre, a plain yet spirited governess, and her arrogant, brooding Mr. Rochester. Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine--one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved. Hailed by William Makepeace Thackeray as "the masterwork of great genius," <i>Jane Eyre</i> is still regarded, over a century later, as one of the finest novels in English literature.</p><h2>Anna Karenina (Movie Tie-in Edition): Official Tie-in Edition (Vintage Classics)</h2><p><p><b>The official movie tie-in to the major motion picture starring Keira Knightly, Jude Law, Emily Watson, and&nbsp;Aaron Johnson, directed by Joe Wright. This edition also includes the screenplay by Tom Stoppard.<br></b><br>Leo Tolstoy&#x2019;s classic story of doomed love is one of the most admired novels in world literature. Generations of readers have been enthralled by his magnificent heroine, the unhappily married Anna Karenina, and her tragic affair with dashing Count Vronsky.<br><br>In their world frivolous liaisons are commonplace, but Anna and Vronsky&#x2019;s consuming passion makes them a target for scorn and leads to Anna&#x2019;s increasing isolation. The heartbreaking trajectory of their relationship contrasts sharply with the colorful swirl of friends and family members who surround them, especially the newlyweds Kitty and Levin, who forge a touching bond as they struggle to make a life together. <i>Anna Karenina</i> is a masterpiece not only because of the unforgettable woman at its core and the stark drama of her fate, but also because it explores and illuminates the deepest questions about how to live a fulfilled life.<br>&nbsp;<br>Translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Some people say <i>Anna Karenina</i> is the single greatest novel ever written, which makes about as much sense to me as trying to determine the world's greatest color. But there is no doubt that <i>Anna Karenina</i>, generally considered Tolstoy's best book, is definitely one ripping great read. Anna, miserable in her loveless marriage, does the barely thinkable and succumbs to her desires for the dashing Vronsky. I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that 19th-century Russia doesn't take well to that sort of thing.A beautiful society wife from St. Petersburg, determined to live life on her own terms, sacrifices everything to follow her conviction that love is stronger than duty. A socially inept but warmhearted landowner pursues his own visions instead of conforming to conventional views. The adulteress and the philosopher head the vibrant cast of characters in <i>Anna Karenina,</i> Tolstoy's tumultuous tale of passion and self-discovery.<br>This novel marks a turning point in the author's career, the juncture at which he turned from fiction toward faith. Set against a backdrop of the historic social changes that swept Russia during the late nineteenth century, it reflects Tolstoy's own personal and psychological transformation. Two worlds collide in the course of this epochal story: that of the old-time aristocrats, who struggle to uphold their traditions of serfdom and authoritarian government, and that of the Westernizing liberals, who promote technology, rationalism, and democracy. This cultural clash unfolds in a compelling, emotional drama of seduction, betrayal, and redemption.</p><h2>Dissociation in Children and Adolescents: A Developmental Perspective</h2><p>Presenting a comprehensive developmental approach, this book examines the origins and course of normal and pathological dissociation in children and adolescents.

Was he criticizing the worldview of the conservative aesthete, Pavel Kirsanov, and the older generation, or that of the radical, cerebral medical student, Evgenii Bazarov, representing the younger one? The critic Dmitrii Pisarev wrote at the time that the novel "stirs the mind . . . because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity." N. N. Strakhov, a close friend of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, praised its "profound vitality." It is this profound vitality in Turgenev's characters that carry his novel of ideas to its rightful place as a work of art and as one of the classics of Russian Literature.</p><p>Ann Pasternak Slater is a Fellow of St. Anne&#x2019;s College, Oxford. She is the author of <b>Shakespeare the Director</b> and the translator of the memoirs of Alexander Pasternak, <b>A Vanished Present</b>.&#x201c;Well, Petr, no sight of him yet?&#x201d; asked a gentleman about forty years old wearing a short, dusty coat and checkered trousers, standing hatless on the low steps of an inn on the road. It was the twentieth of May 1859. He was addressing his servant, a round-cheeked young man with whitish down on his chin and small, lackluster eyes.<br><br>The servant, whose turquoise earring, variegated hair plastered with grease, and refined movements all betokened a man belonging to the newest, most advanced generation, glanced down the road condescendingly, and replied: &#x201c;No, sir, no sight of him at all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No sight of him?&#x201d; repeated his master.<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; the servant responded a second time.<br><br>His master sighed and sat down on a little bench. Let&#x2019;s introduce him to the reader while he sits looking around thoughtfully, his feet tucked up underneath him.<br><br>His name is Nikolai Petrovich Kirsanov. He owns a fine estate located fifteen versts from the inn that has two hundred serfs or, as he puts it&#x2014;ever since he arranged to share his land with the peasants&#x2014;&#x201c;a farm&#x201d; of nearly five thousand acres. His fa- ther, an army general who served during 1812, was a coarse, half- educated, but not villainous Russian. He worked hard all his life, first commanding a brigade, then a division, and lived continually in the provinces where, by virtue of his rank, he played a fairly important role. Nikolai Petrovich was born in the south of Russia, as was his elder brother, Pavel, of whom more later. He was educated at home until he was fourteen, surrounded by underpaid tutors and casually obsequious adjutants, in addition to all the usual regimental and staff personnel. His mother, a member of the Koliazin family, was called Agathe as a girl but Agafokleia Kuzminishna Kirsanova as a general&#x2019;s wife. She was one of those &#x201c;mother-commanders&#x201d; who wore elaborate caps and rustling silk dresses. In church, she was the first to advance to kiss the cross; she talked a great deal in a loud voice; she let her children kiss her hand in the morning and gave them her blessing at night&#x2014;in a word, she conducted her life just as she pleased.<br><br>As a general&#x2019;s son, Nikolai Petrovich was expected, like his brother Pavel, to enter the army, although he not only lacked courage but even deserved to be called a little coward. He broke his leg on the very day that word of his commission arrived, however, and had to lie in bed for two months, staying &#x201c;gimpy&#x201d; to the end of his days. His father gave up on him and let him pursue civilian life. He took Nikolai Petrovich to Petersburg as soon as his son was eighteen and enrolled him in the university. Pavel happened to have been made an officer in the Guards at about the same time. The young men started to live together in one apartment under the distant supervision of a cousin on their mother&#x2019;s side, Ilia Koliazin, a high-ranking official. Their father returned to his division and his wife, and every once in a while just sent his sons large gray sheets of paper with a military clerk&#x2019;s handwriting scrawled across them. At the bottom of these sheets, carefully encircled by a scroll design, were inscribed the words, &#x201c;Petr Kirsanov, General-Major.&#x201d; In 1835, Nikolai Petrovich graduated from the university; General Kirsanov retired the same year after an unsuccessful review, and brought his wife to live in Petersburg. He was about to rent a house in the Tavricheskii garden and join the English Club when he suddenly died of a stroke. Agafokleia Kuzminishna died shortly thereafter&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t ever accustom herself to the dull life of the capital; she was consumed by the emptiness of existence away from the regiment.<br><br>Meanwhile, before his parents&#x2019; death and somewhat to their chagrin, Nikolai Petrovich had managed to fall in love with the daughter of his former landlord, a minor official named Prepolovenskii. She was a pretty and, as they say, advanced young woman; she used to read serious articles in the &#x201c;Science&#x201d; column of journals. He married her as soon as the mourning period for his parents was over. Having left the civil service, in which his father had procured him a position through his connections, Nikolai Petrovich lived with his Masha in perfect bliss, first in a country villa near the Lesnii Institute, then in a pretty little apartment in town that had a clean staircase and a chilly drawing room, and after that in the countryside, where he finally settled down and where within a short time his son, Arkadii, was born. The young couple lived quite happily and tranquilly. They were hardly ever apart; they read books together, they sang and played duets together on the piano. She tended her flowers and looked after the poultry-yard; he occasionally went hunting and busied himself with the estate. Arkadii grew up just as happily and tranquilly.<br><br>Ten years passed like a dream. In 1847, Kirsanov&#x2019;s wife died. He almost succumbed to this blow&#x2014;his hair turned gray in the space of just a few weeks. He got ready to go abroad in order to distract his mind a bit . . . but then came the year 1848. He unwillingly returned to the countryside, and after a rather prolonged period of inactivity, he began to take an interest in improving the management of his estate. In 1855, he took his son to the university; he spent three winters with him in Petersburg, hardly going out anywhere and trying to make friends with Arkadii&#x2019;s youthful companions. He hadn&#x2019;t been able to go the previous winter&#x2014;and thus we see him in May of 1859, already completely gray, somewhat stout, and slightly stooped. He was waiting for his son, who&#x2019;d just graduated, as he&#x2019;d once done himself.<br><br>The servant, motivated by a sense of propriety, and possibly not eager to remain under his master&#x2019;s eye anyway, had gone beyond the gate and was smoking a pipe. Nikolai Petrovich bowed his head and began to stare at the crumbling steps. A large, mottled hen walked toward him sedately, treading firmly on its long yellow legs; a muddy cat gave him an unfriendly look, coyly twisting itself around a railing. The sun was scorching; the odor of hot rye bread drifted out from the semidark passage of the inn. Nikolai Petrovich lapsed into daydreams. The words &#x201c;my son . . . a graduate . . . Arkasha . . .&#x201d; continually revolved in his head. He tried to think about something else, but the same thoughts kept recurring. He recalled his deceased wife. . . . &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t live to see this!&#x201d; he murmured sadly. A plump, dark-blue pigeon flew into the road and hastily took a drink from a puddle near the well. Nikolai Petrovich began to watch it, but his ear had already caught the sound of approaching wheels.<br><br>&#x201c;It seems that they&#x2019;re coming, sir,&#x201d; the servant announced, returning from the gateway.<br><br>Nikolai Petrovich jumped up and directed his gaze along the road. An open carriage with three horses harnessed abreast appeared; he caught a glimpse of the blue band of a student&#x2019;s cap and the familiar outline of a beloved face inside the carriage.<br><br>&#x201c;Arkasha! Arkasha!&#x201d; Kirsanov cried and ran forward, waving his arms. . . . A few moments later, his lips were pressed against the beardless, dusty, sunburned cheek of the young graduate.<br><br>II<br><br>&#x201c;Let me dust myself off first, Papa,&#x201d; Arkadii said in a voice that was tired from the journey but boyish and clear as a bell, as he cheerily responded to his father&#x2019;s caresses. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you all dirty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing, it&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; Nikolai Petrovich assured him, smiling tenderly and slapping the collar of his son&#x2019;s coat as well as his own twice with his hand. &#x201c;Let me take a look at you, let me take a look at you,&#x201d; he added, stepping back from him; then he immediately hurried toward the courtyard of the inn, calling out, &#x201c;This way, this way, and bring the horses at once.&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai Petrovich seemed to be much more agitated than his son; it was as if he were a little lost, and a little shy. Arkadii stopped him.<br><br>&#x201c;Papa,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;let me introduce you to my good friend, Bazarov, about whom I&#x2019;ve written to you so often. He&#x2019;s been kind enough to promise to stay with us.&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai Petrovich promptly turned around and, walking up to a tall man wearing a long, loose coat with tassels who&#x2019;d just gotten out of the carriage, he warmly shook that man&#x2019;s bare, reddened hand, which hadn&#x2019;t been extended to him immediately.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m extremely pleased,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;and grateful for your kind willingness to visit us. . . . May I ask your first name and patronymic?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Evgenii Vasilich,&#x201d; Bazarov answered in a lazy but powerful voice and, turning down the collar of his coat, revealed his entire face to Nikolai Petrovich. It was long and thin, with a broad forehead, a nose that was flat at the base and sharp at the tip, large greenish eyes, and drooping, sandy-colored sideburns. His face was illuminated by a calm smile, radiating self-assurance and intelligence.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you won&#x2019;t find it too boring at our home, dear Evgenii Vasilich,&#x201d; continued Nikolai Petrovich.<br><br>Bazarov&#x2019;s thin lips moved almost imperceptibly. He made no formal reply and merely took off his cap. His long, thick, dark-blond hair couldn&#x2019;t conceal some large protuberances on his capacious head.<br><br>&#x201c;Well then, Arkadii,&#x201d; Nikolai Petrovich began again, turning to his son, &#x201c;should the horses be harnessed right away, or would you like to rest?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll rest at home, Papa.

In this book an eminent art historian examines the intriguing history and significance of these international art exhibitions.<br><br>Francis Haskell begins by discussing the first &#x201c;Old Master&#x201d; exhibitions in Rome and Florence in the seventeenth century and then moves to eighteenth-century France and the efforts to organize exhibitions of contemporary art that would be an alternative to the official ones held by the Salon. He next describes the role of the British Institution in London and the series of remarkable loan exhibitions of Old Master paintings there. He traces the emergence of such nationalist exhibitions as the Rembrandt exhibition held in Amsterdam in 1898, the first modern &#x201c;blockbuster&#x201d; exhibit. Demonstrating how the international loan exhibition was a vehicle of foreign and cultural policy after the First World War, he gives a fascinating account of several of these, for example the Italian Art exhibition held at Burlington House in 1930 (Botticelli in the Service of Fascism). He describes the initial reluctance of major museums to send pictures on potentially damaging journeys and explains how this feeling gave way to cautious enthusiasm. Finally, in a polemical chapter, he explores the type of publications associated with exhibitions and with the criticism and scholarship that have centered upon them. <br></p><p>Francis Haskell, who died in January 2000, was one of the most original and influential art historians of the twentieth century. His books included Patrons and Painters, Past and Present in Art and Taste, History and Its Images, and, with Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique, all published by Yale University Press. He retired as professor of the history of art at Oxford University in 1995.The late Oxford art historian Haskell (Patrons and Painters, etc.) produced permanently valuable books on the social climates that produced great art in earlier centuries. This study is based on various lectures, and was put into final shape by Haskell's coauthor on Taste and the Antique, Nicholas Penny. It describes how international blockbuster museum exhibits aroseDfrom 17th-century "old master" retrospectives in Italy and the bureaucratic "salons" of France beginning in the 18th century, to the 19th-century nationally based shows (Rembrandt in Amsterdam) and today's global extravaganzasDalong with some of their worst excesses. In nine chapters devoted to specific exhibits, Haskell goes behind the scenes, delving through miles of source material to explain the political context for many of the shows. In a striking chapter, "Botticelli in the Service of Fascism," he describes a landmark 1930 London exhibit of Italian art that turned into a propaganda platform for Mussolini. Haskell is openly horrified at the risks museum directors now habitually run in order to win brownie points with their trustees and other art world honchos, putting their irreplaceable artworks in harm's way: "Miles above us jets speed through the skies carrying their freight of Titians and Poussins, Van Dycks and Goyas." Throughout, Haskell's clear prose brings what is often a highly detailed and specialist discussion into clear focus, though it won't make it much past the art and art historical worlds.

Search no further." --Martin Amis, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><p> Originally published in 1953, Saul Bellow's modern picaresque tale grandly illustrates twentieth-century man's restless pursuit of an elusive meaning. Augie March, a young man growing up in Chicago during the Great Depression, doesn't understand success on other people's terms. Fleeing to Mexico in search of something to fill his restless soul and soothe his hunger for adventure, Augie latches on to a wild succession of occupations until his journey brings him full circle. Yet beneath Augie's carefree nature lies a reflective person with a strong sense of responsibility to both himself and others, who in the end achieves a success of his own making. A modern-day Columbus, Augie March is a man searching not for land but for self and soul and, ultimately, for his place in the world.</p><p> "A book of extraordinary and massive power ... plainly one of the richest of twentieth-century American novels." --Alfred Kazin</p><p> "[Bellow's] body of work is more capacious of imagination and language than anyone else's....

Fitzgerald and Kandice L. Grossman is the first comprehensive text to approach the study of sexuality from a sociological perspective. Drawing on the most up-to-date social scientific research on sexuality, it discusses fundamental concepts in the field and helps students integrate knowledge about sexuality into their larger understanding of society. Topics covered include the emergence of sexual identities, inequalities and discrimination faced by sexual and gender minorities, heterosexual and cisgender privilege, activism and mobilization to challenge such discrimination, the commodification of sexuality, and the ways sexuality operates in and through various institutions. Throughout the text, the authors show how sexuality intersects with other statuses and identities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <br></p><p>"This is an important addition to the sociology of sexualities market.

After the war, the ensuing debt forced Congress to grant the central banking scheme another 20-year charter. The author explains how this spurred General Andrew Jackson--fed up with the central bank system and Nathan Rothschild&#x2019;s control of Congress--to enter politics and become president in 1828. Citing the financial crises engineered by the banks, Jackson spent his first term weeding out Rothschild agents from the government. After being re-elected to a 2nd term with the slogan &#x201c;Jackson and No Bank,&#x201d; he became the only president to ever pay off the national debt. When the Central Bank&#x2019;s charter came up for renewal in 1836, he successfully rallied Congress to vote against it.<br><br>The author explains how, after failing to regain their power politically, the Rothschilds plunged the country into Civil War. He shows how Lincoln created a system allowing the U.S. to furnish its own money, without need for a Central Bank, and how this led to his assassination by a Rothschild agent. With Lincoln out of the picture, the Rothschilds were able to wipe out his prosperous monetary system, which plunged the country into high unemployment and recession and laid the foundation for the later formation of the Federal Reserve Bank--a banking scheme still in place in America today.</p><p>Xaviant Haze is a researcher of ancient manuscripts and alternative history, exploring and documenting his findings on lost cities and the myths of the pre-diluvian world. The coauthor of <i>The Suppressed History of America</i>, he lives in South Beach, Florida.<b>Abraham Lincoln Discovers the Truth <br> <br>1862-1865 <br> <br></b>The war years of 1862 and 1863 were tough on the president as the cost of the war was sinking the nation into abstract bankruptcy. With no alternative he was forced to seek financial aid from the Rothschilds. They welcomed Lincoln with open arms and open wallets. His giant stature and immediate charisma was duly noted by the bankers as they dined on beef stroganoff and toasted to their forefathers and the end of the war. But the Rothschilds weren&#x2019;t interested in ending the war, at least not until their central bank had been rechartered. A topic they discussed with passion as they laid the terms of the deal out to a heavyhearted Lincoln. <br> <br>They agreed to provide Lincoln the currency he needed at 35 percent interest on all monies loaned as long as they were allowed a new charter for another United States central bank. Lincoln held a poker face during the meeting, and once it ended told them that he would be in touch. What he did next angered the Rothschilds and pretty much sealed his fate. Recognizing the Rothschild&#x2019;s scam and furious over the high level of interest they attempted to charge him, Lincoln made the boldest presidential move yet--he printed his own debt-free money. Called &#x201c;the greenback,&#x201d; it was the prototype for modern American currency. <br> <br>Lincoln&#x2019;s friend Colonel Edmund Dick Taylor had mentioned the idea of creating a new currency in order to pay for the war. Taylor was well versed in Rothschild economics and had made a fortune in the coal-mining business. He, like a lot of northerners in 1863, was worried that the South might actually win. Based on Taylor&#x2019;s suggestions Lincoln intentionally insulted the Rothschilds by authorizing Congress to print the greenbacks as full legal treasury tender. Lincoln flooded the economy with 450 million dollars, which was distinguished from all other currencies by the green ink on the back of the bills. The money was a godsend as soldiers got paid and the economy boomed. Though Lincoln was greatly concerned at having to issue fiat-based currency backed by nothing, he declared, &#x201c;We gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had, their own paper money to pay their own debts.&#x201d; <br> <br>As the Rothschilds fumed over being betrayed, Lincoln introduced state loans void from the bankers&#x2019; clutches, financing the Civil War on state-issued credit. Fearing a wicked response, Lincoln slept with one eye open as he fought the bankers over the greenbacks and a proposed American national banking system. He also freed the slaves with his &#x201c;Emancipation Proclamation,&#x201d; a move that infuriated the Rothschilds and crippled the South&#x2019;s economic future. But Lincoln couldn&#x2019;t truly escape the Rothschilds, at least not when it came to money. His personal banker, Jay Cooke, was hired to sell small government bonds to the average citizen, but instead he sold them in London and hired over 2,500 sub-agents who hawked over a billion dollars&#x2019; worth of bonds in three years. Cooke was later forced to pay the treasury back after getting caught backroom dealing with the Rothschilds and J. P. Morgan. But as reelection time neared Lincoln had control over both Congress and America&#x2019;s banking system as he enacted the Rothschild counter measure called the National Bank and Currency Acts of 1863 and 1864. Lincoln&#x2019;s measures included a nationally regulated private banking system intent on issuing cheap credit to build industries non-reliant on the southern plantation system. <br> <br>Lincoln&#x2019;s financial reform plans were working. The money changers in London were furious, and furthermore the war efforts on behalf of their southern investments weren&#x2019;t panning out either as new industrial inventions began to obliterate the South&#x2019;s chances of winning. To combat Lincoln&#x2019;s paper-money experiment and the impending end of the Civil War, the Rothschilds surrounded America&#x2019;s borders with foreign troops waiting to swoop in and finish off their wounded foe with a planned military invasion. The British were situated up north in Canada with over 11,000 troops waiting to invade New York, while both France and Spain had united in Mexico with another 30,000 soldiers willing to carve up America on the Rothschild&#x2019;s bidding. But the money masters&#x2019; intricately planned two-pronged attack was thwarted by Tsar Alexander II of Russia, the only European monarch not indebted to the Rothschilds banking empire. <br> <br>Russia shared a good economic relationship with America, which inspired them to end serfdom and emulate the American practice of private farming. Russia even copied the modern construction methods of the U.S. Navy and by 1864 had built the third largest fleet of ships in the world, trailing only behind Britain and France. When Lincoln learned that Tsar Alexander II also rejected the Rothschilds&#x2019; continual attempts to set up a central bank in Russia, he saw that the two leaders were in the same boat, and so he asked for the Tsar&#x2019;s help during the Civil War. The Tsar obliged and sent his fleet across the Atlantic with a specific warning to the Rothschilds that an attack on America would be considered an attack on Russia as well. <br> <br>The Tsar&#x2019;s Russian fleet steamed into New York Harbor on September 24, 1863, while his Pacific fleet anchored in San Francisco a few weeks later. Lincoln&#x2019;s secretary of the Navy, Gideon Wells, wrote in his diary, &#x201c;They arrived at the high tide of the Confederacy and the low tide of the North, causing England and France to hesitate long enough to turn the tide for the North.&#x201d;3 This deliberate naval move by the Tsar and his Russian fleet prevented France and Britain from carrying out their invasion plans as the Rothschilds weren&#x2019;t ready to risk war with Russia. The British and French troops amassed on America&#x2019;s borders waited in vain to repossess the wealth of the colonies, but while they waited their moment slipped away as the war ended and Lincoln was declared the victor.</p><h2>Complete Works</h2><p>A compact volume offering all the bard&#39;s poems and plays with a comprehensive glossary and indices</p><p></p><h2>Dulcie Dando, Soccer Star</h2><p>Prohibited from joining the school soccer team because she is a girl, Dulcie Dando--unequivocally the best soccer player in the whole school--waits for the day of the big game and seizes an opportunity to play anyway.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-- Coming from a family of daring ladies, it's no surprise that Dulcie excels at soccer.

As Kemp Tolley explains in this entertaining history of the patrol in which he was to later serve, the presence of gunboats along the river greatly benefited the integrity of the shoreline factories. Tolley was a young naval officer in the 1930s when assigned gunboat duty, first in the <i>Mindanao</i>, then in the <i>Tutuila</i>, and finally the <i>Wake</i> in August 1941. His colorful description of life as a "river rat" is filled with anecdotes about the resourceful and high-spirited sailors who manned the old riverboats in that distant land.<br><p>In the process of telling their story he covers a century of Chinese history, replete with warlords and mandarins, bandits and kidnappers, missionaries and mercenaries, riots and revolution. He presents a knowledgeable summary of the political situation in China up to World War II, including the bombing of the Panay, the siege of Shanghai, and the Nanking incident.

He showed that, far from being an exotic novelty, Hinduism was an important, legitimate spiritual tradition with valuable lessons for the West. <i>Pathways to Joy</i> is a selection of 108 of his sacred teachings on Vedanta philosophy. In accessible and powerful prose, Vivekananda illuminates the four classical yoga paths &#x2014; karma, bhakti, raja, and jnana &#x2014; for the different natures of humankind. The messages focus on the oneness of existence; the divinity of the soul; the truth in all religions; and unifying with the Divine within. Invaluable and inspiring, the selections also explore karma, maya, rebirth, and other great revelations of Hinduism.</p><p>Dave Deluca has presented thousands of seminars, classes and trainings on all aspects of personal growth during his 20 years as a professional speaker and seminar leader. A long-time student of the ancient Vedanta wisdom of Oneness, he has been one of the West&#39;s most passionate and highly regarded Vedantic teachers for over a decade. He presented Vedanta at the Parliament of the World&#39;s Religions in Barcelona, Spain, and continues to give keynote addresses, classes and seminars on spiritual growth at conferences, churches, temples, learning centers and retreats all over America and Canada.No library of Yoga study would be complete without the revered teachings of Swami Vivekananda, and no edition of his teachings brings them to us more beautifully than Dave DeLuca&#x2019;s <i>Pathways to Joy</i>.&#x201d;<br> <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br> Dave DeLuca has done a wonderful service by compiling Swami Vivekananda&#x2019;s greatest teachings on classical yoga into one book.

The one thing people seem to agree on, however, is that schools need to be held accountable&#x2014;we need to know whether what they&#x2019;re doing is actually working. But what does that mean in practice?<br> &nbsp;<br> High-stakes tests. Lots of them. And that has become a major problem. Daniel Koretz, one of the nation&#x2019;s foremost experts on educational testing, argues in <i>The Testing Charade</i> that the whole idea of test-based accountability has failed&#x2014;it has increasingly become an end in itself, harming students and corrupting the very ideals of teaching. In this powerful polemic, built on unimpeachable evidence and rooted in decades of experience with educational testing, Koretz calls out high-stakes testing as a sham, a false idol that is ripe for manipulation and shows little evidence of leading to educational improvement. Rather than setting up incentives to divert instructional time to pointless test prep, he argues, we need to measure what matters, and measure it in multiple ways&#x2014;not just via standardized tests.<br><br>Right now, we&#x2019;re lying to ourselves about whether our children are learning. And the longer we accept that lie, the more damage we do. It&#x2019;s time to end our blind reliance on high-stakes tests. With <i>The Testing Charade</i>, Daniel Koretz insists that we face the facts and change course, and he gives us a blueprint for doing better. <br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Daniel Koretz </b>is the Henry Lee Shattuck Professor of Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the author of <i>Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us</i>.<br> &nbsp;"In his new book, Daniel Koretz, an eminent testing expert at Harvard University, has skillfully dissected the multiple negative consequences of the education reforms of the 2000s." (Diane Ravitch <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>"A stunningly good, meticulously researched perspective." (Nancy Flanagan <i>Ed Week, Best of the Year</i>)<br><br>"A vivid and disturbing account of pervasive design problems in test-driven accountability systems, pernicious effects of high-stakes testing, and the extremes to which accountability testing has taken us. . . . In addition to being highly readable, engaging, and accessible to a broad, nontechnical audience, <i>The Testing</i><i>Charade</i> is lucid, measured in tone, well argued, and amply documented. Koretz makes a powerful case that our test-based accountability policies are seriously misguided. His reminders throughout that testing per se is not the problem and his repeated calls for studies of better alternatives make his case all the more compelling. In the final third of the book, he begins to chart a better way forward. The ideas here are well worth attending to." (<i>American Journal of Education</i>)<br><br>"Written in an authoritative but conversational tone that smoothly communicates both educational theory and real-world examples, <i>The Testing Charade</i> offers a trenchant look at one of our societal pillars." (<i>Civil Engineering</i>)<br><br><b>"</b>A scathing critique. . . . What is significant about this book is the thorough and relentless critique by a testing expert who carefully and sometimes technically dissects the evidence." (<i>National Education Policy Center</i>)<br><br>"Dan Koretz, a distinguished academic, turns out to be a wonderful storyteller and a gifted writer as well. Combining the latest data and moving stories of people caught up in the accountability frenzy, Koretz demonstrates that high-stakes testing has corrupted instruction, led educators to cut corners and even cheat, and produced sham increases in scores, while yielding precious little in the way of real improvements in student learning.<i>The Testing Charade</i> is accessible, riveting, and spot-on. Please put this important book on your must read list."

All ages.</p><p>Grade 1-4-- Hague's visual interpretation of Wilde's stories is more formal and traditional than Ed Young's The Happy Prince (S. &amp; S., 1992) or P. Craig Russell's comic book version of Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde (NBM, 1992), but it works exceedingly well. His paintings and page decorations are solidly composed and finely detailed; his palette is darker than usual, achieving a note of somberness that complements these sentimental tales of self-sacrifice and misery, friendship and joy. The pictures are lush and velvety, burnished with gold. The collection includes all nine of the pieces Wilde wrote for his sons--"The Remarkable Rocket," "The Devoted Friend," and "The Nightingale and the Rose," appear alongside the more familiar "The Happy Prince," "The Selfish Giant," and "The Birthday of the Infanta." This handsome, well-made volume is eminently suitable for gift-giving; libraries looking for the complete set of these tales need look no further. --Linda Boyles, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4-6, younger for reading aloud.

Robinson&#39;s beautiful pictures originally appeared in 1896 in the first illustrated edition.</p><p><blockquote><i> "The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings."</i> </blockquote><p> With this "Happy Thought," Robert Louis Stevenson speaks for all the delights of childhood. But he doesn't stop there. <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, written over a century ago, is filled to the brim with what are usually considered to be the first real poems written for children. This classic volume is an old friend to the generations of readers who were brought up on "I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me/ And what can be the use of him is more than I can see." In this perfectly lovely edition, the gossamer art of Jessie Willcox Smith (who first illustrated Stevenson's poems in the early years of the 20th century) is reproduced in all its charming glory. Black and white drawings throughout and eight full-page, warmly colorful paintings show beautiful, yet pleasantly imperfect children, busy at their daily activities--climbing trees, watching their reflections in a river, or sick in bed with an army of toy soldiers on guard. Place this on the shelf next to Mother Goose, Dr. Seuss, and Peter Rabbit. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Throughout his life, <b>Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson</b> was tormented by poor health. Yet despite frequent physical collapses&#x2014;mainly due to constant respiratory illness&#x2014;he was an indefatigable writer of novels, poems, essays, letters, travel books, and children&#x2019;s books. He was born on November 13, 1850, in Edinburgh, of a prosperous family of lighthouse engineers. Though he was expected to enter the family profession, he studied instead for the Scottish bar. By the time he was called to the bar, however, he had already begun writing seriously, and he never actually practiced law. In 1880, against his family&#x2019;s wishes, he married an American divorcï¿½e, Fanny Vandegrift Osbourne, who was ten years his senior; but the family was soon reconciled to the match, and the marriage proved a happy one.All his life Stevenson traveled&#x2013;often in a desperate quest for health. He and Fanny, having married in California and spent their honeymoon by an abandoned silver mine, traveled back to Scotland, then to Switzerland, to the South of France, to the American Adirondacks, and finally to the south of France, to the South Seas. As a novelist he was intrigued with the genius of place: <b>Treasure Island</b> (1883) began as a map to amuse a boy. Indeed, all his works reveal a profound sense of landscape and atmosphere: <b>Kidnapped</b> (1886); <b>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</b> (1886); <b>The Master of Ballantrae</b> (1889).In 1889 Stevenson&#x2019;s deteriorating health exiled him to the tropics, and he settled in Samoa, where he was given patriarchal status by the natives. His health improved, yet he remained homesick for Scotland, and it was to the &#x201c;cold old huddle of grey hills&#x201d; of the Lowlands that he returned in his last, unfinished masterpiece, Weir of Hermiston (1896).Stevenson dies suddenly on December 3, 1894, not of the long-feared tuberculosis, but of a cerebral hemorrhage. The kindly author of <b>Jekyll and Hyde</b> went down to the cellar to fetch a bottle of his favorite burgundy, uncorked it in the kitchen, abruptly cried out to his wife, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with me, what is this strangeness, has my face changed?&#x201d;&#x2014;and fell to the floor. The brilliant storyteller and master of transformations had been struck down at forty-four, at the height of his creative powers.</p><h2>Communication Intervention: Birth to Three</h2><p>What can be done in infancy to help all children achieve their maximum communication potential?

This ground-breaking, visually spectacular book was designed from cognitive and educational research on how students think, learn, and study. <p>Nearly all information in the book is built around 2,600 photographs and stunning illustrations, rather than being in long blocks of text that are not articulated with figures. These annotated illustrations help students visualize geologic processes and concepts, and are suited to the way most instructors already teach. To alleviate cognitive load and help students focus on one important geologic process or concept at a time, the book consists entirely of two-page spreads organized into 20 chapters. Each two-page spread is a self-contained block of information about a specific topic, emphasizing geologic concepts, processes, features, and approaches. These spreads help students learn and organize geologic knowledge in a new and exciting way. </p><p>Inquiry is embedded throughout the book, modeling how scientists investigate problems. The title of each two-page spread and topic heading is a question intended to get readers to think about the topic and become interested and motivated to explore the two-page spread for answers. Each chapter is a learning cycle, which begins with a visually engaging two-page spread about a compelling geologic issue. Each chapter ends with an Investigation that challenges students with a problem associated with a virtual place. The world-class media, spectacular presentations, and assessments are all tightly articulated with the textbook. This book is designed to encourage students to observe, interpret, think critically, and engage in authentic inquiry, and is highly acclaimed by reviewers, instructors, and students.</p></p><p>Julia K.

The author, a contributor to Horticulture and The New York Times , writes gracefully and knowledgeably about more than 20 fruit species easily grown in North America's temperate climate. Gardeners tired of the same old apples and pears will relish the prospect of growing such exotic fruits as the maypop, a cold-hardy passionfruit, the enticingly fragrant clove currant and the diminutive but intensely flavorful alpine strawberry. Part of what makes these fruits worthy of attention is that they are surprisingly easy to grow; they require far less spraying and pruning than their more commonly cultivated cousins, and--best of all for Northern gardeners--they demand some degree of winter cold. Reich provides detailed information, leavened with anecdotes and quotes from sources ancient and modern, on each fruit's cultivation, propagation, harvest and use, plus a list of cultivars. Appendixes cover botanical nomenclature, how to plant, propagate and care for the fruits and, last but not least, where to purchase them. Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This delightful book describes 19 fruits including maypops, pawpaws, medlars, jujubes, and Asian pears. Fruits were selected for being at home in a temperate climate, tasting good to eat out of hand, requiring minimal upkeep, and possessing ornamental beauty. For each, the compact, authoritative, and interesting text offers history, description, propagation, harvest, uses, and cultivars. A precise vocabulary--"frugiverous, frass, bletting"--sparkles in a clearly written text that is never overly technical. Appendixes list mail-order sources as well as more planting, pruning, and propagation advice. Both amateurs searching for the one tree right for their backyard and serious fruiterers interested in propagation will find this book useful and valuable.

This introductory look at dynamical systems includes investigating the rates of approach to attracting and indifferent fixed points to the discovery of Feigenbaum&#39;s constant; exploring the window struct Full description</p><p>A First Course in Chaotic Dynamical Systems: Theory and Experiment is the first book to introduce modern topics in dynamical systems at the undergraduate level. Accessible to readers with only a background in calculus, the book integrates both theory and computer experiments into its coverage of contemporary ideas in dynamics. It is designed as a gradual introduction to the basic mathematical ideas behind such topics as chaos, fractals, Newtons method, symbolic dynamics, the Julia set, and the Mandelbrot set, and includes biographies of some of the leading researchers in the field of dynamical systems. Mathematical and computer experiments are integrated throughout the text to help illustrate the meaning of the theorems presented. Chaotic Dynamical Systems Software, Labs 16 is a supplementary laboratory software package, available separately, that allows a more intuitive understanding of the mathematics behind dynamical systems theory. Combined with A First Course in Chaotic Dynamical Systems, it leads to a rich understanding of this emerging field.Professor Robert L. Devaney received his A.B. from Holy Cross College and his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1973. He taught at Northwestern University, Tufts University, and the University of Maryland before coming to Boston University in 1980. He served there as chairman of the Department of Mathematics from 1983 to 1986. His main area of research is dynamical systems, including Hamiltonian systems, complex analytic dynamics, and computer experiments in dynamics. He is the author of An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems, and Chaos, Fractals, and Dynamics: Computer Experiments in Modern Mathematics, which aims to explain the beauty of chaotic dynamics to high school students and teachers.</p><h2>Liberty and Coercion: The Paradox of American Government from the Founding to the Present</h2><p><p><b>How the conflict between federal and state power has shaped American history</b></p><p>American governance is burdened by a paradox. On the one hand, Americans don't want "big government" meddling in their lives; on the other hand, they have repeatedly enlisted governmental help to impose their views regarding marriage, abortion, religion, and schooling on their neighbors. These contradictory stances on the role of public power have paralyzed policymaking and generated rancorous disputes about government&#x2019;s legitimate scope. How did we reach this political impasse? Historian Gary Gerstle, looking at two hundred years of U.S. history, argues that the roots of the current crisis lie in two contrasting theories of power that the Framers inscribed in the Constitution.</p><p>One theory shaped the federal government, setting limits on its power in order to protect personal liberty. Another theory molded the states, authorizing them to go to extraordinary lengths, even to the point of violating individual rights, to advance the "good and welfare of the commonwealth." The Framers believed these theories could coexist comfortably, but conflict between the two has largely defined American history. Gerstle shows how national political leaders improvised brilliantly to stretch the power of the federal government beyond where it was meant to go&#x2015;but at the cost of giving private interests and state governments too much sway over public policy. The states could be innovative, too. More impressive was their staying power. Only in the 1960s did the federal government, impelled by the Cold War and civil rights movement, definitively assert its primacy. But as the power of the central state expanded, its constitutional authority did not keep pace. Conservatives rebelled, making the battle over government&#x2019;s proper dominion the defining issue of our time.</p><p>From the Revolution to the Tea Party, and the Bill of Rights to the national security state, <i>Liberty and Coercion</i> is a revelatory account of the making and unmaking of government in America.</p></p><p><p>"Brilliant."<b>--Michael Kazin, <i>Politico</i></b></p><p>"A landmark work of political history that will make liberals, conservatives, and radicals rethink their assumptions about the weak or strong American state. With great authority and muscular prose, Gerstle explains the development of the United States as a narrative of continuities and discontinuities, growing centralization, and enduring limits on federal power."<b>--Michael Kazin, author of <i>American Dreamers</i></b></p><p>"A beautifully intricate history of the twin impulses of American political life: the movement toward a more powerful state, and away from one. Gary Gerstle tracks this contradiction across its many different dimensions--from the states to the federal government, and from private morality to public policy--to shed much-needed light on the deep-seated conflicts of the present."<b>--David Runciman, author of <i>The Confidence Trap</i></b></p><p>"Gary Gerstle is one of the country's best and most thoughtful historians. He specializes in shedding light on important parts of our national story that we have overlooked. After reading <i>Liberty and Coercion</i> you will never be able to think about our founding or our present in quite the same way. Gerstle shows persuasively how both impulses were present at the creation of our republic and how the states retained an enormous reservoir of coercive power long after the Bill of Rights was adopted. This is a genuinely pathbreaking work."<b>--E. J. Dionne Jr., author of <i>Souled Out</i> and <i>Our Divided Political Heart</i></b></p><p>"This impressive analytical history of the liberal state--liberal in its quest for freedom, statist in its forcible claims and behavior--offers a compelling, original framework within which to consider some of the most vexing issues in American life, from the founding to the present. Written with verve and based on a depth of understanding, <i>Liberty and Coercion</i> is sweeping, reflective, and significant."<b>--Ira Katznelson, author of <i>Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time</i></b></p><p>"This outstanding, bold, and provocative book offers a sophisticated but very accessible exploration into the relationship between the state and governance throughout U.S. history. Gerstle writes with authority, economy, and clarity, and I can't think of another work like this one. It will become an important part of the conversation about the character of American politics."<b>--Steven Hahn, author of <i>A Nation under Our Feet</i></b></p><p>"As <i>The Federalist Papers</i> pointed out, an enduring constitution must create not only a government strong enough to accomplish intensely difficult tasks but also controls over the government that preserve liberty and autonomy. Tracing, explaining, and evaluating these delicate balances over three centuries require an extraordinary historian. That person is Gary Gerstle and his book <i>Liberty and Coercion</i> will shape how we understand American governance for years to come."<b>--Jennifer Hochschild, coauthor of <i>Creating a New Racial Order</i></b></p><p>"<i>Liberty and Coercion</i> is a much-needed, cogent, and deftly executed exploration of the American state. Gerstle's lucid and widely informed argument provides insights never advanced before and will attract a wide readership.

He does not humiliate us. He does not criticize us. He does not ask us to make a resolution to try harder. Rather, He takes us aside and asks us to reaffirm our love for Him. </p><p>Peter miserably failed his Lord when he fled with the other disciples from the Garden of Gethsemane. Later, he publicly denied that he even knew Jesus. Peter must have wondered if he had been capable of being Jesus&#x2019; disciple when he was unfaithful to Jesus in His most crucial hour. </p><p>As you begin a new year, you may be painfully aware that you have failed your Lord in many ways. Perhaps you were not faithful. Perhaps you disobeyed His word to you. Perhaps you denied Him by the way you lived. Jesus will take you aside, as He did Peter. He will not berate you. He will not humiliate you. He will ask you to examine your love for Him. He asked Peter, "Do you love Me?" If your answer, like Peter&#x2019;s, is "Yes, Lord," He will reaffirm His will for you. If you truly love Him, you will obey Him (John 14:15). Jesus does not need your resolutions, your recommitments, or your promises to try harder this year. If your resolve to obey God last year did not help you to be faithful, it will not make you successful this year. Jesus asks for your love. If you truly love Him, your service for Him in the new year will be of the quality that He desires. </p><p>Woe Is Me! </p><p>So I said: "Woe is me, for I am undone!<br> Because I am a man of unclean lips,<br> And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;<br> For my eyes have seen the King,<br> The Lord of hosts."<br> Isaiah 6:5 </p><p>An exalted view of God brings a clear view of sin and a realistic view of self. A diminished view of God brings a reduced concern for sin and an inflated view of self. Isaiah may have been satisfied with his personal holiness until he saw the Lord in His unspeakable glory. Isaiah&#x2019;s encounter with holy God made him immediately and keenly aware of his own unholiness and the sinfulness of those around him. It is impossible to worship God and remain unchanged. The best indication that we have truly worshiped is a changed heart. </p><p>Have we so conformed ourselves to a sinful world that we are satisfied with unholy living? Have we sunk so far below God&#x2019;s standard that when someone does live as God intended, we consider that person "superspiritual"? If we only compare our personal holiness to those around us, we may be deceived into believing that we are living a consecrated life. Yet when we encounter holy God, our only response can be "Woe is me!" </p><p>You will not see those around you trusting Jesus until they recognize a clear difference between you and the rest of the world. God wants to sanctify you as He is holy. When God deals with you, there will be a radical degree of purity about your life that is absolutely different from what the world can produce. The world, including those closest to you, will be convinced you serve a holy God by your consecrated life. </p><p>Making a Difference </p><p>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king&#x2019;s delicacies. <br>Daniel 1:8 </p><p>Would you dare to believe that God, who called you to Himself and equipped you with His Spirit, could work mightily through you? Have you made the connection between the time and place in which you live and God&#x2019;s call upon you? World events never catch God by surprise. He placed you precisely where you are for a purpose. </p><p>Daniel did not let the temptations of his day interfere with his relationship to the Lord. He knew that to make his life useful to God he must be obedient in all things. Regardless of what the most powerful king in the world commanded, Daniel refused to compromise what he knew God required of him. </p><p>History is replete with examples of Christian men and women who believed that God would work through them to make a significant difference for His kingdom. God placed Esther strategically in the king&#x2019;s court at a crucial time when she could save the lives of God&#x2019;s people (Esther 4:14). God placed Joseph strategically to become the most powerful adviser to the pharaoh in Egypt and to save Jacob and his family from a devastating drought (Gen. 41:39&#x2013;40). </p><p>Are you allowing your surroundings to determine how you invest your life? Or are you letting God use you to make a difference in your generation? Ask God to reveal His purposes for you and His will for your life today.</p></p><h2>The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941-1945</h2><p>In his landmark The Abandonment of the Jews, David S. Wyman argues that a substantial commitment to rescue European Jews on the part of the United States almost certainly could have saved several hundred thousand of the Nazis&#39; victims. The definitive work on its subject, The Abandonment of the Jews is the winner of the National Jewish Book Award, the Anisfield-Wolf Award, the Present Tense Literary Award, the Stuart Bernath Prize from the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, and the Theodore Saloutos Award of the Immigration History Society. It was also nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award.</p><p>It has long been alleged that officials in the Roosevelt administration knew, in surprising detail, about Adolf Hitler's plans to exterminate all the Jews in Nazi Europe--and that these officials did little to prevent the massacre, refusing asylum to shiploads of Jewish refugees and failing to order the bombing of railway lines leading to Auschwitz, Treblinka, and other concentration camps. David S. Wyman examines the evidence, concluding that senior American officials could indeed have saved many thousands, if not millions, of European Jews by intervening earlier. In this controversial work, he suggests, with good cause, that a combination of anti-Semitism and indifference to anything not perceived as being of direct strategic importance to the United States indirectly led to countless deaths. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>This book is to inform the readers of the Jewish dilemma. My book was written to inform the public of the atrocities of the U.S. Government during WWII. The government at the time knew what was going on and did nothing to stop the slaughter of millions of innocent Jews. -- David S. Wyman</p><h2>An Introduction to Women&#39;s Studies: Gender in a Transnational World</h2><p>This anthology introduces students to the modern period's history of key ideas related to sexual difference, gender, race, class, and sexuality. While most introductory Women's Studies textbooks focus on the United States, even if they add multiculturalism to the discussion, this book looks at women in diverse locations around the world and encourages students to think about gender in a transnational rather than a purely U.S. context. The selections provide students in the U.S. with a way to understand points of view from other locations and cultures, especially crucial in the post-9-11 geopolitical situation. <p>The transnational approach to understanding gender brings Women's Studies into an era of globalization by connecting women&#x2019;s issues in the United States to women&#x2019;s issues elsewhere. The book shows how colonialism and imperialism, as they spread across the world, shaped ideas about gender as much as other modern phenomena. It addresses issues of power and inequality by focusing on historical connections rather than solely on commonalties. </p><p>The readings are truly interdisciplinary, drawing upon scholarly work in many disciplines and interdisciplinary fields as well as non-scholarly sources.

She received an ordinary education and, upon leaving school at the age of sixteen, embarked on a program of independent study to further her intellectual growth. In 1841 she moved with her father to Coventry, where the influences of &#x201c;skeptics and rationalists&#x201d; swayed her from an intense religious devoutness to an eventual break with the church. The death of her father in 1849 left her with a small legacy and the freedom to pursue her literary inclinations. In 1851 she became the assistant editor of the <b>Westminster Review</b>, a position she held for three years. In 1854 came the fated meeting with George Henry Lewes, the gifted editor of <b>The Leader</b>, who was to become her adviser and companion for the next twenty-four years. Her first book, <b>Scenes of a Clerical Life</b> (1858), was followed by <b>Adam Bede</b> (1859), <b>The Mill on the Floss</b> (1860), <b>Silas Marner</b> (1861), and <b>Middlemarch</b> (1872).

Said. Addressed to students and scholars throughout the humanities, these essays address what Antonio Gramsci--the founder of the Italian communist party--called the subaltern classes, reexamining well-known historical and political events, such as Gandhi's role in India, from a Marxist perspective. Together, the essays examine aspects of the analysis of domination, with special reference to the critique of imperialism, in an attempt to rectify the elitist bias characteristic of much academic work on India. A ground-breaking work of considerable pedagogical relevance for courses dealing with colonialism and imperialism in literature, sociology, anthropology, politics, and history, <em>Subaltern Studies</em> also features a comprehensive glossary of Indian terms for readers not familiar with Indian history.<br></p><p>These ten essays culled from the five volumes of &#39;Subaltern Studies&#39; aim to &#39;promote a systematic and informed discussion of subaltern themes in the field of South Asian studies, and thus help to rectify the elitist bias characteristic of much reserach and academic work in this particular area.&#39;Ranajit Guha is at Australian National University.

Foucault was asked to reply, but remained silent. <i>Forget Foucault</i> (1977) made Baudrillard instantly infamous in France. It was a devastating revisitation of Foucault's recent History of Sexuality&#x2015;and of his entire oeuvre&#x2015;and also an attack on those philosophers, like Gilles Deleuze and Fï¿½lix Guattari, who believed that desire could be revolutionary. In Baudrillard's eyes, desire and power were interchangeable, so desire had no place in Foucault's work. There is no better introduction to Baudrillard's polemical approach to culture than these pages, in which Baudrillard dares Foucault to meet the challenge of his own thought. This Semiotext(e) edition of Forget Foucault is accompanied by a dialogue with Sylvï¿½re Lotringer, "Forget Baudrillard," a reevaluation by Baudrillard of his lesser-known early works as a post-Marxian thinker. Lotringer presses Baudrillard to explain how he arrived at his infamous extrapolationist theories from his roots in the nineteenth and early twentieth century social and anthropological works of Karl Marx, Marcel Mauss, and Emil Durkheim.</p></p><p>Jean Baudrillard (1929&#x2013;2007) was a philosopher, sociologist, cultural critic, and theorist of postmodernity who challenged all existing theories of contemporary society with humor and precision. An outsider in the French intellectual establishment, he was internationally renowned as a twenty-first century visionary, reporter, and provocateur.</p><h2>Hamlet (Arden Edition of the Works of William Shakespeare)</h2><p>This text is part of a series of selected Shakepeare texts designed for student use. The introduction provides criticsim, covering themes, characters and dramatic structure, and helpful notes are provided at the right level on every page, facing the text.</p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society. The detailed stage history records an ongoing process of discovery, as successive performers have found what it is in the play that will speak most powerfully to the audiences of their own times. The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in this century, direction and design.This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.</p><h2>Tess of the D&#39;Urbervilles (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>Set in Hardy's Wessex, Tess is a moving novel of hypocrisy and double standards. Its challenging sub-title, A Pure Woman, infuriated critics when the book was first published in 1891, and it was condemned as immoral and pessimistic. <br> It tells of Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of a poor and dissipated villager, who learns that she may be descended from the ancient family of d'Urbeville. In her search for respectability her fortunes fluctuate wildly, and the story assumes the proportions of a Greek tragedy. It explores Tess's relationships with two very different men, her struggle against the social mores of the rural Victorian world which she inhabits and the hypocrisy of the age.</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, plays, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy is edited by Rex Gibson, Director, Shakespeare and Schools Project.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Everything, in a word, that was un-British but characteristic of ancien-regime France. Recently historians have questioned such comfortably simplistic views. This lively investigation of ``absolutism'' in action -- continent-wide but centred on a detailed comparison of France and England -- dissolves the traditional picture to reveal a much more complex reality; and in so doing illuminates the varied ways in which early-modern Europe was governed.<br></p><p><p> <b> <i>'This thoughtful, wide-ranging and often spikey book xxx; a valuable corrective to much that has been written on the period.

Discrepant abstraction is hybrid and partial, elusive and repetitive, obstinate and strange. It includes almost everything that does not neatly fit into the institutional narrative of abstract art as a monolithic quest for artistic purity. Exploring cross-cultural scenarios in twentieth-century art, this second volume in the Annotating Art's Histories series alters our understanding of abstract art as a signifier of modernity by revealing the multiple directions it has taken in wide-ranging international contexts.Impure, imperfect, and incomplete, the version of abstraction that emerges from this global journey&#x2015;from Hong Kong and Islamic regions to Canada, Australia, Europe, and the United States&#x2015;shows how the formal ingenuity of abstract art has been cross-fertilized, from abstract expressionism onwards, by creative discrepancies that arise when disparate visual languages are brought into dialogue. <i>Discrepant Abstraction</i> is essential reading for students, practitioners and anyone curious about cross-cultural interaction in the visual arts.

In <i>Saffron Shores</i>, she brings to the table the sensual aromas and exquisite flavors of the Southern Mediterranean in a celebration of its rich Jewish heritage. From Morocco comes a vibrant orange salad strewn with olives; from Algeria, a hearty tagine of chicken with quince; from Tunisia, a spicy eggplant puree; from Libya, a saffron and paprika infused fish soup-all are authentic, kosher, and a delightful introduction to a healthful, flavorful cuisine for the modern cook. A fascinating exploration of cultures and cuisine, lush with images, <i>Saffron Shores</i> is as beautiful to look at as its always-accessible recipes are delicious to eat.</p></p><p>Though most of us think of Jewish cooking as Eastern European in origin, there's an alluring second traditional Jewish cuisine, that of the Mediterranean. Joyce Goldstein's <i>Saffron Shores</i> explores the most southerly branch of this exotic repertoire, which includes the spice-infused dishes of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Goldstein, who pursued Italian- and Spanish-Jewish cooking in <i>Cucina Ebraica</i> and <i>Sephardic Flavors</i>, is ideally suited to introduce this largely unexplored and delicious cuisine; she offers 100 recipes for a wide range of dishes--appetizers through sweets--including don't-miss treats like Lamb Tagine with Prunes and Honey, Baked Fish Stuffed with Almond Paste, and Cumin Flavored Meatballs with Onion Jam and Spicy Tomato Sauce. Simple in conception, and mostly easy to do, the dishes work well for modern cooks who want something "different" without going to great lengths to get it.<p>Beginning with a brief history of the cooking, and presenting its flavor profile (like that of the Jews who settled in the Ottoman Empire, the Southern Mediterranean palate favors vivid spiciness with the likes of cumin and cinnamon, plus a penchant for sweet-and-sour combinations), she then introduces the tempting recipes. Of special interest is a section on savory pastries like Iraqi Chicken and Chick Pea Pastries and Lebanese Spinach Turnovers, "labors of love," says Goldstein, that are nonetheless worth a cook's involvement, and sweets, such as Syrian Rice Pudding and Raisin and Walnut Jam Tart. (Also included is a recipe for preparing boxed couscous that finally makes the most of this obvious convenience.) With holiday menus and color photos throughout, the book is truly welcome. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Joyce Goldstein , chef, author, and teacher, is an acknowledged expert on both Jewish and Mediterranean cooking, as revealed in such books as Enoteca (0-8118-2825-5) and her unprecedented exploration of Jewish cuisine from the diaspora begun in Cucina Ebra</p><h2>The Wicca Handbook</h2><p>Describes the basics of Wicca, presents lists of correspondences, and provides guidelines for creating spells, rituals, and tools to help with issues such as love, health, and money.</p><p>Witch.

Granz, who died in 2001, was iconoclastic, independent, immensely influential, often thoroughly unpleasant&#x2015;and one of jazz&#x2019;s true giants. Granz played an essential part in bringing jazz to audiences around the world, defying racial and social prejudice as he did so, and demanding that African-American performers be treated equally everywhere they toured. In this definitive biography, Hershorn recounts Granz&#x2019;s story: creator of the legendary jam session concerts known as Jazz at the Philharmonic; founder of the Verve record label; pioneer of live recordings and worldwide jazz concert tours; manager and recording producer for numerous stars, including Ella Fitzgerald and Oscar Peterson.</p><p>&#x201c;The JAZZ AT THE PHILHARMONIC concerts were a turning point in my life. My fellow Californian Norman Granz figured it out. This biography lays out, in impressive detail and insight, the incredible contribution of Mr. Granz to the world of music and art. The deed of the vast recordings of ART TATUM says it all.&#x201d; &#x2015;Clint Eastwood<br><br>&#x201c;Norman Granz was one of the most important people in the world of jazz. He did more to escalate respect for jazz and raise our salaries than anybody else. He absolutely loved jazz and jazz musicians. I&#x2019;m honored to have shared a beautiful friendship with Norman for many, many years. Hopefully, with this incredible book by Tad Hershorn, the world will have a chance to learn about Norman, and his phenomenal contribution to our beloved music&#x2015;jazz.&#x201d;&#x2015;Clark Terry, author of <i>Clark: The Autobiography of Clark Terry</i><br><br>&#x201c;Tad Hershorn&#x2019;s <i>Norman Granz: The Man Who Used Jazz for Justice</i> is a relentlessly readable, rigorously researched, deeply empathic portrait of the complex and heroic man who was arguably the greatest champion of this great American art form&#x2015;and its great artists. Essential reading for anyone who loves jazz.&#x201d; &#x2015;James Kaplan, author of <i>Frank: The Voice</i><br><br>&#x201c;Norman Granz was renowned as a vivid force in jazz history, both as a producer of invaluable classic recordings by many of the music&#x2019;s most original performers and also for his world-wide, all-star Jazz at the Philharmonic tours. Moreover, he broke the color line dividing jazz audiences by mandating the end of segregated seating his continually popular concerts. Yet until this magisterial, deeply researched biography of Granz by Tad Hershorn, there has been no full-scale inside account of the achievement and combats of this often larger-than-life personality who, without playing an instrument, was so swingingly instrumental in making jazz an international language.&#x201d; &#x2015;Nat Hentoff, author of <i>At the Jazz Band Ball: Sixty Years on the Jazz Scene</i><br><br>&#x201c;Norman Granz, one of the most significant non-musicians in jazz history, took gutsy public stands but remained a private person.

This great American story is a must read&#x2015;and not just for jazz fans!&#x201d; &#x2015;Dan Morgenstern, author of <i>Living with Jazz</i><br><br>&#x201c;Norman Granz was an institution in jazz. He was loved by some, hated by others, often controversial, and always fearless. But Granz was also elusive and, until now, sometimes came across as more symbol than man. Tad Hershorn has changed all that in this stunning, beautiful biography of the music's most relentless advocate of social justice.&#x201d; &#x2015;Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original</i><br><br>&#x201c;Norman Granz was an important man, and Tad Hershorn tells his story with a fearless compassion grounded in yeoman research. Imperious, vain, and rude, Granz was also generous, inventive, and brave. He fought valiantly for jazz and civil rights, made pots of money, and never failed to bet it on his passions and beliefs. If you do not know him, you couldn't ask for a better introduction than Hershorn's judicious portrait; if you think you do know him, you are in for more than a few surprises.&#x201d; &#x2015;Gary Giddins, author of <i>Visions of Jazz</i><br><br>"You're probably smarter than you present yourself." &#x2015;Norman Granz to author, 2001<b>Tad Hershorn</b> is an archivist at the Institute for Jazz Studies at Rutgers University.</p><h2>Fishing: How the Sea Fed Civilization</h2><p><b>Humanity&#x2019;s last major source of food from the wild, and how it enabled and shaped the growth of civilization</b><br><br> In this history of fishing&#x2014;not as sport but as sustenance&#x2014;archaeologist and best-selling author Brian Fagan argues that fishing was an indispensable and often overlooked element in the growth of civilization. It sustainably provided enough food to allow cities, nations, and empires to grow, but it did so with a different emphasis. Where agriculture encouraged stability, fishing demanded movement. It frequently required a search for new and better fishing grounds; its technologies, centered on boats, facilitated movement and discovery; and fish themselves, when dried and salted, were the ideal food&#x2014;lightweight, nutritious, and long-lasting&#x2014;for traders, travelers, and conquering armies. This history of the long interaction of humans and seafood tours archaeological sites worldwide to show readers how fishing fed human settlement, rising social complexity, the development of cities, and ultimately the modern world.</p><p>From a best-selling author and archaeologist, a global history of humanity&#x2019;s last major source of food from the wild and how it enabled and shaped the growth of our modern world.

What they don't realize&#x2014;and what Daniel Hillis's short book brilliantly demonstrates&#x2014;is that computers' seemingly complex operations can be broken down into a few simple parts that perform the same simple procedures over and over again. Computer wizard Hillis offers an easy-to-follow explanation of how data is processed that makes the operations of a computer seem as straightforward as those of a bicycle.Avoiding technobabble or discussions of advanced hardware, the lucid explanations and colorful anecdotes in <i>The Pattern on the Stone</i> go straight to the heart of what computers really do. Hillis proceeds from an outline of basic logic to clear descriptions of programming languages, algorithms, and memory. He then takes readers in simple steps up to the most exciting developments in computing today&#x2014;quantum computing, parallel computing, neural networks, and self-organizing systems.Written clearly and succinctly by one of the world's leading computer scientists, <i>The Pattern on the Stone</i> is an indispensable guide to understanding the workings of that most ubiquitous and important of machines: the computer.</p><p>Daniel Hillis has made a career of puzzling over the nature of information and the mechanisms that put information to use. Now, he's distilled his accumulated knowledge of computer science into <i>The Pattern on the Stone</i>, a glorious book that reveals the nature of logical machines simply and elegantly.<p> Millions of times each second, to the drumbeat of a clock signal, electronic computers compare digital values. These comparisons, and the actions taken in response to them, are what computers are all about at their lowest levels, and, with the help of this book, they're not hard to comprehend. Moving on from the nature of logical circuits, the author deconstructs software and the mechanisms it employs to solve problems.</p><p> Hillis then stands atop the building blocks he's arranged into a sturdy foundation and discusses the future of computing. Parallel processors already are in use, and neural networks with limited abilities to learn and adapt have proved quite good at certain jobs. Hillis explores the potential of both these technologies. Then, he throws some light on quantum computing and evolving systems--emerging ideas that promise to make computers much more powerful, and thereby change the world. <i>--David Wall</i></p>As an MIT graduate student, <b>W.

He was famous in his day as a translator, orator, and historian, and was the best-selling author of the fifteenth century. Bruni's <i>History of the Florentine People</i> in twelve books is generally considered the first modern work of history, and was widely imitated by humanist historians for two centuries after its official publication by the Florentine Signoria in 1442.

This volume, and the entire series of which it forms only a part, is a crucial contribution to the prosperity of Renaissance studies today. While Bruni's history is an important source for understanding Bruni's humanism, as well as Florentine humanism more generally in the fifteenth century, its complete translation should expand our understanding of Bruni's importance in European intellectual history beyond the confines of the Baron thesis and the nature of Florentine civic humanism. He should play an equally important role in the history of modern historical writing, on a par with Machiavelli, Bodin and Gibbon. Elegantly translated and modestly priced, Hankins' volume should go a long way to restoring Bruni to the historiographical prominence that he rightly enjoyed in his own time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Jurdjevic</b><b>, </b><b><i>Sixteenth Century Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The text of Bruni's <i>History</i> that Hankins has given us is an excellent text that marks a notable advance on its predecessors and will allow the modern reader to draw the greatest profit from reading this work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Lettere Italiane</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Bruni, in trying to demonstrate that Florence could trace its legitimate republican tradition back to deep antiquity, wrote a history of his city on the model of the ancient history of Rome by Livy. As he did so, he read Livy's eloquent, stagy book in a very imaginative, critical way. From the ancient historian's idealized account of virtuous Romans, Bruni reconstructed the virtuous and powerful world of their enemies, the Etruscans--from whom, he claimed, the modern Tuscans were descended. In Bruni's historical imagination, Livy's stories of Horatius, heroically defending the bridge across the Tiber, and Mucius Scaevola, thrusting his hand into the fire to show his contempt for death, metamorphosed into instances of Roman weakness, superstition and dishonesty.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony T.

These stories, although written with exemplary style, make the flesh crawl but not pleasurably, as reliable suspense fare does. Each focuses on a female doing in a male or, more often, herself. "The Breeder" Elaine persists in giving birth until her husband Douglas goes irrevocably mad, trying to support 17 children. "The Victim" is Cathy, fond of claiming she's been raped repeatedly in her nubile adolescence. During her career as an airline hostess, Cathy's sexuality pays better in rich gifts than in sympathetic attention. But greed and vanity spell the lush girl's doom. From the book's overall tone, readers could infer that its origin was bitter contempt for humans of either gender. The entries fail as real satire, which is always amusing, regardless of its stings. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Conversations Worth Having: Using Appreciative Inquiry to Fuel Productive and Meaningful Engagement</h2><p><b>Conversations can be critical and destructive, or they can be generative and productive.

I had taken on several new roles: becoming a manager, a wife; I felt overwhelmed by the obstacles and responsibilities that had come my way. After learning to practice the Appreciative Inquiry principles outlined in this book, I have been able to shift my viewpoint to focusing on the solutions that I am capable of pursuing instead of giving all my energy to the problems I face. This book has provided me with tools that have helped me to express myself genuinely, listen to and understand&nbsp;others, rearrange my responsibilities and become a more valuable version of myself- at work and home.&nbsp;It's helped me deal with conflict in a more productive manner.&nbsp;By flipping my attitude and tone of the conversations I engage in, I find myself in a more balanced, peaceful state of mind.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jackie and Cheri - thank you so much for sharing this book with me.

Peter Pettinger, himself a concert pianist, describes Evans`s life (the personal tragedies and commercial successes), his musicmaking (technique, compositional methods, and approach to group playing), and his legacy. The book also includes a full discography and dozens of photographs.</p><p>Perhaps it was a white jazz musician&#39;s need to negate his very ordinary American boyhood, or maybe it was in the genes he inherited from his alcoholic father--no one can be quite sure--but Bill Evans, one of the most influential American jazz pianists ever, was a drug addict. He picked up his habit shortly after joining the Miles Davis Sextet in the 1950s, but it took Evans more than 20 years to be swallowed by the abyss of heroin, methadone, and cocaine. Sitting at the piano in the shadow of Davis, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones--the era&#39;s paragons of cool--could not have been easy for the retiring musician who suffered harsh ribbing at the hands of both bandmates and fans. Ironically, as the drugs distorted Evans&#39;s body and soul, his fingers coaxed ever more sublime music from his keyboard. Biographer Peter Pettinger was himself a professional pianist and a longtime listener of Evans, so he is expert at articulating the nuances of the music. He is perceptive too in exploring the forces that imbued in one life so much beauty and so much pain. The result is a book that is both a memorial to a burdened man and an homage to his transcendent music."[A] fine new biography... packed with... shrewd critical commentary." -Terry Teachout, New York Times Book Review <p>"Pettinger sets out to catalogue and explain Evans' wide-ranging genius... The making of every important Evans recording is discussed, and as he follows the extreme ups and downs of a career vexed by heroin addiction and other problems, Pettinger shows how the personal helped shape the artistic sensibility of this jazz innovator." -Tom Moon, Philadelphia Inquirer </p><p>Selected as a 1998 Notable Book of the Year by the New York Times Book Review </p><p>Winner of the 1999 ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award in the Pop Books Category</p></p><h2>Painted Prayers: The Book of Hours in Medieval and Renaissance Art</h2><p>Introduces Books of Hours to general readers, and features examples of illuminated pages from medieval and Renaissance books.

His enthusiasm for what he dubs "the Medieval best-seller" is thoroughly infectious. "Books of Hours linked church and home," he writes. "The entire celestial court, God and his cosmos, could be held within the palms of one's hands." Wieck has turned his scholarly, historical material into a page-turner. Given the hypnotic beauty of the manuscripts themselves, with all their flayings, blessings, betrayals, and epiphanies, <i>Painted Prayers</i> should be a bestseller in its own right.Roger S.

This new, definitive volume presents Beckett&#x2019;s poetry in the order it was composed, from pre-war to post-war, and contains previously unpublished and never-before-reprinted work. Along with his translations of Apollinaire, Mallarme, Rimbaud, and many others, this book brings together all of the pieces from <i>Collected Poems in English and French</i>, selections from <i>Mexican Poetry: An Anthology</i> (translated by Beckett), and poems that appeared in his novels and plays. Extensive critical notes by editors Seï¿½n Lawlor and John Pilling detail the circumstances of their composition, explaining obscure allusions and references (frequently sourced to Beckett's notebooks), and identifying resonances across his oeuvre.<br><br>Poetry allowed Beckett to reconcile his penchant for opulent phrasing with his preference for minimalism, and it profoundly influenced his approach to the drama and fiction for which he&#x2019;s revered.

Beckett&#x2019;s poetic successes, in any genre, are matters of musical cadence, of the rich interplay of sounds: they obey the Imagist prescription to compose in the rhythm of the musical phrase, not in that of the metronome. . . .

Derek Mahon</p><h2>A Reforming People: Puritanism and the Transformation of Public Life in New England</h2><p>A revelatory account of the aspirations and accomplishments of the people who founded the New England colonies, comparing the reforms they enacted with those attempted in England during the period of the English Revolution. <br><br>Distinguished historian David D. Hall looks afresh at how the colonists set up churches, civil governments, and methods for distributing land. Bringing with them a deep fear of arbitrary, unlimited authority grounded in either church or state, these settlers based their churches on the participation of laypeople and insisted on &#x201c;consent&#x201d; as a premise of all civil governance. Encouraging broad participation and relying on the vigorous use of petitioning, they also transformed civil and criminal law and the workings of courts. The outcome was a civil society far less authoritarian and hierarchical than was customary in their age&#x2014;indeed, a society so advanced that a few dared to describe it as &#x201c;democratical.&#x201d; They were well ahead of their time in doing so.<br><br>As Puritans, the colonists also hoped to exemplify a social ethics of equity, peace, and the common good. In a case study of a single town, Hall follows a minister as he encourages the townspeople to live up to these high standards in their politics. This is a book that challenges us to discard long-standing stereotypes of the Puritans as temperamentally authoritarian and their leadership as despotic. Hall demonstrates exactly the opposite. Here, we watch the colonists as they insist on aligning institutions and social practice with equity and liberty.<br><br>A stunning re-evaluation of the earliest moments of New England&#x2019;s history, revealing the colonists to be the most effective and daring reformers of their day.</p><p><b>David D.

He is the author or editor of numerous books on American religious and cultural history.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>"Arbitrary" or "Democratical"?<br><i><br>The Making of Colony Governments</i><br><br>Two months after arriving in Massachusetts in June 1630, the officers of the Massachusetts Bay Company held a "court" in their new capacity as administrators of a colony. That day, the business at hand was deciding how to pay the ministers the Company had recruited and what to do about the soaring prices of supplies and servants' labor. By year's end, this little group was enacting rules to ensure the validity of commercial contracts and the distribution of property left by those who died. It was crucial, too, that the group arrange for grants of land so farming could begin, negotiate with the local Indians, and discipline abuses of speech, sex, and alcohol. All these were preliminary acts of statecraft, prelude to decision-making of far greater consequence about the structure and practice of civil government.1<br><br>One aspect of this process, the implementing of "godly rule," is taken up in Chapter Three. Here the focus is on the creation of five different colony-wide governments; the making of town governments follows in Chapter Two. Telling this story for Massachusetts, where the process is most fully documented, carries us from the early 1630s, when arguments first broke out about civil governance, to the mid-1640s, when these disputes reached something of a climax. Elsewhere, people were deciding much more promptly on what to do-the Plymouth colonists between 1636 and 1639, the founders of Connecticut in 1638 and 1639, the founders of New Haven between 1638 and 1639, and the towns in what became Rhode Island between 1639 and 1647, the year in which these towns came together in a colony-wide federation with a charter from Parliament.<br><br>Everywhere, the process turned on how to answer questions about statecraft so difficult to resolve in England that civil war broke out in 1642. For many Englishmen-and certainly for the colonists, had they lingered in their homeland-the great difficulty at the beginning of the 1640s was the insistence of Charles I on his authority as monarch and the corollary he added to this argument, that "Parliaments are altogether in my power" (as he told the Parliament of 1626) "for their calling, sitting and dissolution," an assertion he amplified by likening that body to a "council" and "therefore" limited in what it could undertake. To the dismay of many, Charles was extending his protection to clergymen who defended the divine right of kings to rule and using that argument to validate imposing taxes without the consent of Parliament.2 No one of Puritan sympathies in late-1620s England had much love for Charles I, and although the people who sailed for Massachusetts in 1630 could not have foreseen that he would reign without the advice of a Parliament for eleven years (1629-40), they sympathized with the provisions of the Petition of Right (1628), one of them the principle, already noted, that "no tax, tallage, aid or other like charge" could be levied by the Crown unless "by common consent in parliament." In his response, the king stigmatized such statements as "innovations" because they broke "through all respects and ligaments of government, and . . . erect[ed] an universal over- swaying power" in Parliament, "which belongs only to us and not to them."3 Like most members of the Parliament that Charles eventually convened in December 1640, the colonists wanted structures and rules to protect them from a leader who asserted that, in his capacity as king, he had an "absoluta potestas" in matters of justice and was accountable only to God.4<br><br>Well before the Long Parliament began its quest for constitutional means of curtailing the king's authority, the colonists were devising forms of government that anticipated and, in significant ways, surpassed what their countrymen would accomplish. But, like their counterparts in the Long Parliament, the colonists struggled with a series of questions that successive regimes in revolutionary England could not resolve: where did sovereignty lie, and what was the proper balance between authority (government) and liberty? The resonance of these questions owed something to debates within continental humanism and the historical examples of republican Venice, princely Florence, and the wars of religion in sixteenth-century France. Yet their more immediate source was the political culture of early-modern England.<br><br>I<br><br>State-making in Massachusetts Bay was repeatedly contentious, for what men such as John Winthrop wanted by way of government displeased many others. Protest erupted in 1632, reached a temporary peak in 1634, when Winthrop was voted out of office as governor, and returned in full force in the late 1630s and early 1640s. Sometimes a specific policy or ruling led people to mobilize for change, as when Winthrop's resistance to judicial constraint provoked a near paranoia about his intentions "to have the government arbitrary," the same anxiety aroused by the policies of Charles II.5 In continuity with English politics, the underlying issue concerned the structure of government or, more abstractly, the challenge of combining liberty and authority without allowing either to veer off into excess: liberty as anarchy, authority as "arbitrary" or tyrannical. For many of the Massachusetts colonists, the most important business of state-making was to prevent arbitrary rule. For Winthrop and those who shared his thinking, the most important goal was to preserve the authority of the men who held office as governor and magistrates (technically, in Massachusetts, the "Assistants"). Winthrop campaigned persistently for an understanding of "office" that freed it from any direct dependence on consent. Wary of majority rule in a General Court where the deputies outnumbered the magistrates, he insisted on the privilege of a "negative voice" (veto) for the latter. His great bugaboo was "democratie," which he equated with an absence of authority. He would have agreed with his sometime ally John Cotton's remark: "Democracy, I do not conceyve that ever God did ordeyne as a fitt government eyther for church or commonwealth. If the people be governors, who shall be governed?"6 But for others in New England, this word was much more positive.<br><br>The particular questions of statecraft that roiled the colonists emerged in this context. The earliest concerned the levying of taxes, a dispute coinciding with complaints that Winthrop was amassing too much power as the colony's governor. By 1634, the colonists were disputing whether the legislative aspects of governance belonged solely to the governor and magistrates or were shared with the deputies who began to represent each town in the General Court. That year also saw the earliest protest against the negative voice the magistrates were claiming and, simultaneously, a dispute over whether the "freemen" elected all of the colony's officers or only some of them. A few years later, a coalition of deputies and magistrates was challenging Winthrop's insistence on a "Standing Council" empowered to act when the General Court was not in session. Meanwhile, another group that included ministers, magistrates, and laypeople was calling for a written code of laws, a veritable "Magna Carta," as a counterpoint to judicial discretion, which Winthrop favored. For some, the deeper challenge was to articulate the "liberties" shared by everyone in the commonwealth and to code those liberties as "Fundamentall," that is, forever binding on governors and governed. Early and late, some were also insisting on rotation in office.<br><br>The starting point for these disputes was the charter of the Massachusetts Bay Company, which laid out a structure of governance based on a "General Court" of freemen (stockholders, who in 1629 numbered about 125), a smaller group of eighteen "Assistants" to be elected out of the freemen, and a governor and deputy governor. As was typical of such charters, it specified four meetings a year of the General Court, one of them for the purpose of electing officers and the others for doing Company business. In between these sessions, a "Council" of assistants and other officers was in charge. Once the decision was made, in late 1629, to transfer the government of the Company to Massachusetts and the great migration of 1630 had taken place, the effective rulers of the new colony were Winthrop, who became governor in October 1629; Thomas Dudley, named deputy governor shortly before the fleet sailed; and the seven stockholders (now regarded as assistants) who came with them. In October 1630, this small group broke with the charter by admitting 116 men, none of them stockholders, to the status of freemen. No one informed these new freemen of the privileges that were theirs according to the charter, and none of them had access to the actual document.<br><br>Some sixteen months later, the "people" of Watertown protested a tax the council had levied on each of the towns. At the heart of their complaint lay the principle of consent on which every Parliament of the 1620s had insisted, and the rhetoric of their protest-"it was not safe to paye monyes after that sorte for feare of bringinge themselves and posteryty into bondage"-echoed what had been said by Parliamentarians protesting the extraordinary levies Charles I was exacting. Winthrop and the magistrates responded forcefully, insisting on an apology from the leaders of the protest and requiring them to read a "retraction and submission" to the townspeople. Winthrop may have specified the contents of that retraction, that he and the council, but not the freemen, had the "power to make lawes or rayse taxation," a point he justified by likening the small group of magistrates and governor to Parliament, an analogy that, from his point of view, justified the practice of confining the role of the freemen (or people) to electing the magistrates. Possibly as a fillip, he added that anyone with a grievance could voice it at any session of the General Court.7<br><br>Three months later, at the May session of the court, Winthrop had to concede some of the high ground he was claiming. With the power to tax again in dispute, the council agreed that each town could send two men "to be at the nexte Court to advise with the Governor and Assistantes about the raysinge of a public stocke." At this same May meeting of the court, the council also granted the freemen the privilege of electing the governor directly, instead of having him chosen by the magistrates. By August, the uneasiness about the concentration of power in the hands of the few had reached someone as high-placed as Dudley, the deputy governor, who "demanded" that Winthrop specify "the gronde and limittes of his Authoritye whither by the Patent or otherwise." An impassioned back-and-forth between the two men about the scope of the governor's authority-whether the person in that office "had no more Authoritye then everye Assistante (excepte power to call Courtes and precedencye for honor and order)," as Dudley alleged-reached its climax in the accusation that "the Governor intended to make himselfe popular, that he might gaine absolute power, and bringe all the Assistantes under his subiection."8<br><br>This "iealousye" (as Winthrop termed it) extended well beyond the person of Thomas Dudley. In the weeks leading up to the General Court session of May 1634, when a fresh election would determine who held higher office in the colony, the freemen arranged for a grand meeting of delegates from each town to "consider of suche matters as they were to take order in" once the session began. Insisting that Winthrop show them the charter, the group learned from reading the document that the power of making laws belonged to the entire group, freemen as well as magistrates and governor. Winthrop offered to compromise. Alleging it was impractical to call all the freemen together four times a year, he agreed to let delegates from each town "review all Lawes . . . but not to make any newe Lawes" with the exception of taxes, for he accepted the point that "no Assessment should be layd upon the Countrye, without the Consent of suche a Comittee." He acknowledged another constraint on executive authority, that no land be "disposed off" without a similar process of approval.9 But the freemen wanted more. At the May session, Winthrop was temporarily turned out of the governorship and replaced by Dudley. In a toneless description of what followed, Winthrop noted that the new court immediately empowered the delegates or "deputyes" from each town by allowing them to participate in the "makinge" of "Lawes" and "disposinge" of "landes &amp;c." Overnight, as it were, the General Court became a place where deputies outnumbered magistrates, with both having the same authority to make laws.10<br><br>Winthrop and the men who agreed with him were quick to insist on other forms of authority. Returning to the charter, they interpreted it as saying that no measure could pass the court unless it gained the approval of the majority of the council. A fresh crisis<br><br>in the fall of 1634 brought home the possibility of the magistrates being outvoted when, with deputies and magistrates meeting together, the court found itself at odds on whether to approve the request of the people living in Newtown (renamed Cambridge in 1638) to remove to Connecticut. Most of the deputies and a few<br><br>of the magistrates agreed to let them leave, whereupon the other magistrates demanded the privilege of a negative voice or veto over any such measure.11 For the moment, conflict was averted when the Newtowners withdrew their request. But the magistrates' insistence on a veto dramatized the difference between two versions of authority and governance. Some, and especially Winthrop, continued to argue that their authority was greater than (or different from) the authority of the deputies and freemen; the deputies could consent, as could the freemen, but only the magistrates could legislate and act as judges or justices of the peace. Most of the deputies countered that everyone in office shared the same authority to legislate.<br><br>Winthrop's critics had a further point to make. Late that fall or during the winter, Israel Stoughton of Dorchester disputed any negative voice on the basis of a long-existing distinction-frequently employed in the context of discussing the relationship of the supreme sovereignty of Christ to the powers of the clergy who served him- between "magisterial" and "ministerial" modes of authority. In a paper he may have circulated within the General Court, Stoughton declared that, according to the charter, the governor and assistants had only the weaker of these modes, a "ministerial" authority allowed them by "the greater vote of the general courts, and not Magisterial according to their own discretion." "Denying the magistracy among us" was how Winthrop construed this argument. In one respect he was right, for the insistence on ministerial authority implied that the basis of civil power was located in the people. Stoughton also recommended that the deputies have the same negative voice as the magistrates, though his preference was certainly for majority rule.12 Had his suggestions been adopted, much of what differentiated the magistrates from the deputies would have vanished.<br><br>A year later, and even more emphatically in 1636, most of ...</p><h2>Financial Markets and Institutions [RENTAL EDITION] (Pearson Series in Finance)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in financial markets.</i> </p> <br> <p> <b>Real-world applications help students navigate the shifting financial landscape</b> </p> <i> <b>Financial Markets and Institutions</b> </i> takes a practical approach to the changing landscape of financial markets and institutions.

On one side, the wealthy wield power and advantage, wittingly or not, to keep the system operating in their favor&#x2015;all while retreating into enclaves that separate them further and further from the poor and working class. On the other side, those who find it increasingly difficult to keep up or get ahead lash out&#x2015;waging a rhetorical war against the rich and letting anger and resentment, however justifiable, keep us from seeing new potential solutions.</p> <p>But can we suspend both class wars long enough to consider a new way forward? Is it really good for anyone that most of society&#x2019;s wealth is pooling at the very top of the wealth ladder? Does anyone, including the one percent, really want to live in a society plagued by economic apartheid?</p> <p>It is time to think differently, says longtime inequality expert and activist Chuck Collins. Born into the one percent, Collins gave away his inheritance at 26 and spent the next three decades mobilizing against inequality. He uses his perspective from both sides of the divide to deliver a new narrative.</p> <p>Collins calls for a ceasefire and invites the wealthy to come back home, investing themselves and their wealth in struggling communities.&nbsp; And he asks the non-wealthy to build alliances with the one percent and others at the top of the wealth ladder.</p> <p>Stories told along the way explore the roots of advantage, show how taxpayers subsidize the wealthy, and reveal how charity, used incorrectly, can actually reinforce extreme inequality. Readers meet pioneers who are crossing the divide to work together in new ways, including residents in the author&#x2019;s own Boston-area neighborhood who have launched some of the most interesting community transition efforts in the nation.</p> <p>In the end, Collins&#x2019;s national and local solutions not only challenge inequality but also respond to climate change and offer an unexpected, fresh take on one of our most intransigent problems.</p></p><p><p>Chuck Collins is a researcher, campaigner, storyteller, and writer based at the Institute for Policy Studies where he co-edits Inequality.org. He has written extensively on wealth inequality in previous books like 99 to 1, Wealth and Our Commonwealth (with Bill Gates Sr.), and Economic Apartheid in America as well as in The Nation, The American Prospect, and numerous other magazines and news outlets. Collins grew up in the 1 percent as the great grandson of meatpacker Oscar Mayer, but at age 26 he gave away his inheritance. He has been working to reduce inequality and strengthen communities since 1982 and in the process has cofounded numerous initiatives, including Wealth for the Common Good (now merged with the Patriotic Millionaires), United for a Fair Economy, and Divest-Invest. He is also a leader in the transition movement, and a co-founder of the Jamaica Plain New Economy Transition and the Jamaica Plain Forum, both in the Boston-area community in which he lives.</p><p><em><strong>Choice Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>"Drawing on both engaging personal stories and economic research, Collins (Institute for Policy Studies) portrays an 'economic apartheid' of growing inequality of wealth and opportunity in the US, and urges citizens, especially the wealthiest, to recommit to the broader community to address it. Collins describes 'an empathetic barrier to change' that leads rich Americans to deride the industriousness of the less affluent. Raised in a &#x201c;one percent&#x201d; family, Collins understands how the wealthy are cut off from the wider society as their experiences lead them to adopt false myths of self-reliance and meritocracy. These views overlook the roles community and equity play in securing prosperity and well-being for rich and poor Americans. The overvaluing of self-reliance obscures the advantages of family wealth as well as the role of government programs in providing gains for the white middle class (in particular, home ownership) over other groups. Collins calls for empathy and solidarity among the rich, the affluent, and the poor to address inequality and environmental degradation. The book lists ways for the wealthy to connect to the larger society and support policies to bring about an equitable and sustainable future. <strong>Summing Up: Recommended. All readership levels.</strong>"</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>"As the great-grandson of Oscar Meyer, Collins grew up in a wealthy and advantaged family. He considers himself part of the privileged 1 percent, &#x201c;born on third base,&#x201d; with only a short hop to make it to home plate. But Collins believes it&#x2019;s time for our society to come to a different home, one where inequality is addressed in a new way, where the economy can be made more inclusive, and where the 1 percent can engage with the other 99 to become partners in transforming the future. Collins (<em>99 to 1: How Inequality Is Wrecking the World and What We Can Do about It</em>, 2012) once again presents a convincing and deeply thought-provoking argument in favor of not just the need for societal change but the importance of individual action in making change happen. <strong>Written in a well-crafted, conversational style, Collins&#x2019; latest is a gentle yet clear reminder to readers that real change starts by looking outside ourselves and making even the smallest connection with others</strong>.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I have never read a story remotely like the one Chuck Collins has to tell. Born to the one percent, in circumstances few of us can imagine, he grew an outsized conscience and gave up his inherited wealth for a life of fighting the vicious inequality that is destroying our country. Somewhere along the way, he came to understand that the rich can be part of the solution instead of the problem and started organizing them to join in the struggle for a fair economy. The result is an electrifying challenge to the affluent as well as the one percent.&nbsp;&#x2018;Come out of your gated communities and gated hearts,&#x2019; he writes, because outside lies the warmth of human solidarity.&#x201d;--<strong>Barbara Ehrenreich, author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Nickel and Dimed</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Chuck Collins has already organized the rich against&nbsp;their own immediate economic interest. He and his colleagues at the Institute for Policy Studies were instrumental in blocking the Republican repeal of the federal estate tax for the wealthy. So when he writes in&nbsp;<em>Born on Third Base&nbsp;</em>about all the good that can come from the enlightened rich pressing for justice, not just charity, he speaks from experience as both an organizer and a former affluent heir. Partly autobiographical, this empowering light into a brighter future is a narrative you won&#x2019;t want to miss.

Refreshingly, Collins not only talks the talk but walks the walk: at age 26 he gave up his $500,000 trust fund and dedicated his life to ending inequality. The book's first half outlines the problems of uneven wealth distribution, which have been made even more evident by the 2008 economic downturn. This part includes a section addressing racial issues in the U.S. and making the case for federal reparations for slavery. What Collins does even better than describing the challenge is, in the book's second half, outlining significant and specific solutions. He includes 10 elements of a program for the wealthiest 1% to follow, imploring readers to connect with both 'people around us' and 'people who are completely different.' He makes an appeal for 'humanity and empathy' at the book's very beginning, shows how he and others have worked to embody it, and reinforces the importance of this approach at the conclusion.

This book provides the first grassroots social, economic, and cultural history of the shtetl. Challenging popular misconceptions of the shtetl as an isolated, ramshackle Jewish village stricken by poverty and pogroms, Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern argues that, in its heyday from the 1790s to the 1840s, the shtetl was a thriving Jewish community as vibrant as any in Europe.</p><p>Petrovsky-Shtern brings this golden age to life, looking at dozens of shtetls and drawing on a wealth of never-before-used archival material. Illustrated throughout with rare archival photographs and artwork, this nuanced history casts the shtetl in an altogether new light, revealing how its golden age continues to shape the collective memory of the Jewish people today.</p></p><p><p>"This book ushers in the golden age of shtetl scholarship. Challenging the homogenized and sanitized images of East European Jewry that followed its near obliteration, Petrovsky-Shtern combs the archives to reveal how the Jews who lived in these market towns enjoyed great opportunities amid the political tensions between Poland and Russia. A book to be grateful for."<b>--Ruth R. Wisse, author of <i>No Joke: Making Jewish Humor</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Golden Age Shtetl</i> turns upside down the nostalgic image of the shtetl as a decaying Jewish village, presenting the historical shtetl as a place where Jews enjoyed prosperity and stability. Drawing on huge archival evidence, this pathbreaking study challenges our historical mind and provides an innovative account of the Jewish experience in nineteenth-century Russia."<b>--Israel Bartal, author of <i>The Jews of Eastern Europe, 1772-1881</i></b></p><p>"The shtetl, home of most East European Jews for several centuries, has been the subject of endless romantic re-creations in the American Jewish corpus. Finally a serious historian of Russian Jewry gives us a well-documented but still lively and fascinating picture of this lost world. A must-read for anyone seeking to understand the immediate Jewish past."<b>--Art Green, Brandeis University and Hebrew College</b></p><p>"An inspiring and rich study. In this highly innovative book, Petrovsky-Shtern demonstrates how the shtetl in early nineteenth-century Russia constituted a unique context for the unfolding of a proud, resilient, and sustainable Jewish community."<b>--Franï¿½ois Guesnet, University College London</b></p><p>"The shtetl comes to life in all its complexity, vitality, and beauty in Petrovsky-Shtern's new book. Like an archaeologist who uncovers and brings to light one layer after another of a long-gone civilization, he draws on previously untapped archival sources to reconstruct a crucial part of Jewish history."<b>--Serhii Plokhy, Harvard University</b></p><b>Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern</b> is the Crown Family Professor of Jewish Studies at Northwestern University.</p><h2>The Annotated Little Women (The Annotated Books)</h2><p><p><strong>The Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning biographer of Louisa May Alcott illuminates the world of <em>Little Women</em> and its author.</strong></p><p>Since its publication in 1868&#x2013;69, <em>Little Women</em>, perhaps America&#x2019;s most beloved children&#x2019;s classic, has been handed down from mother to daughter for generations.

He graduated from Goddard College, earned a master&#x2019;s degree in the Arts of Teaching at Antioch-Putney Graduate School in Vermont and Yellow Springs, Ohio, and obtained a doctorate in education from Walden University in Naples, Florida. He died in 2017. Myles was born July 5, 1905, in Savannah, Tennessee. Myles Horton entered Cumberland College in Tennessee in 1924 and almost immediately led a student revolt against the hazing of freshmen by fraternities.But it was a summer job in 1927, when he was teaching Bible-school classes to poor mountain people in Ozone, Tennessee, for the Presbyterian Church, that led him in his lifelong work: to build a school that would help people learn to transform the impoverished and oppressed conditions of mountain life. In his senior year at Cumberland and after graduation in 1928, he began organizing interracial meetings of the YMCA.Myles began many years of searching for a plan of action. At the urging of a minister and friend, he attended Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan under the mentorship of Reinhold Niebuhr. His searching took him to the University of Chicago and eventually to the folk-school movement in Denmark before he was ready to return to Tennessee and start his own school.Myles founded the Highlander Folk School in 1932 in Monteagle, Tennessee, about 55 miles northwest of Chattanooga. Highlander was a controversial school in the South that for years taught leadership skills to blacks and whites in defiance of segregation laws. Over those years Myles taught thousands of blacks and whites to challenge entrenched social, economic, and political strictures of a segregated society.He worked closely with labor unions, antipoverty organizations, and civil rights leaders and is often credited with being one of the sparks that ignited the civil rights movement in the United States. Rosa Parks, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., former Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta, Fanny Lou Hamer, and Stokeley Carmichael were among those who attended classes or taught at the school.Myles' first wife, Zilphia Horton, is often credited with joining Pete Seeger, Frank Hamilton, and Guy Carawan in writing new lyrics to an old religious folk tune that became the anthem of the civil rights movement, "We Shall Overcome.""We believe that education leads to action," Myles said at the school's fortieth anniversary celebration in 1972. "If you advocate just one action, you're an organizer. We teach leadership here. Then people go out and do what they want."The Highlander Center also developed a literacy program in the 1950s that taught thousands of blacks to read and write in an effort to get them to register to vote. The Citizenship Schools represent the largest and clearly the most effective mass literacy campaign ever undertaken in the United States&#x2015;successful largely because the campaign was not about literacy, but about the right to participate in a democratic society.The school's integrated classes and its theories brought it to the attention of law-enforcement officials. In 1957 Senator James Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat who served as chairman of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee, investigated Highlander for reported Communist ties. Myles repeatedly denied that he was a Communist or that the school had links with the Communist Party.But in 1960 the Highlander Folk School was ordered closed by the Tennessee courts on the grounds that it had violated its charter by "permitting integration in its school work," that it had operated for Mr. Horton's personal benefit and that it had sold beer in violation of Tennessee law.Myles immediately reopened the school and called it the Highlander Research and Education Center in Knoxville. In 1971 the center moved to its current site, a 100-acre, mountainside farm in New Market, Tennessee.At the school's fiftieth anniversary in 1982, hundreds of former students, including blacks, whites, Mexican-Americans and Native Americans from around the United States came to New Market to pay tribute to Myles&#x2015;an event celebrated in a feature documentary film, You Gotta Move.Myles Horton died in January of 1990.</p><h2>Some Japanese Flowers: Photographs by Kazumasa Ogawa</h2><p>Captivated in his youth by the new technology of photography, Kazumasa Ogawa (1860&#x2013;1929) became one of the most enterprising and important early photographers, technicians, and printers in Japan. Born shortly before the Meiji era (1868&#x2013;1912), or period of &#x201c;enlightened rule,&#x201d; and educated in both the United States and Japan, Ogawa produced a range of illustrated books for the Western market. His work focused on traditional architecture, scenic views, and subjects associated with Japanese culture, such as national festivals, military tableaux, ritual customs, costumed geisha, and flowers.<br><br>An original, deluxe edition of Ogawa&#x2019;s 1896 book of hand-colored collotype prints, titled <i>Some Japanese Flowers</i>, in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum, is reproduced here in its entirety.

The editor of <i>Shashin Shimpo</i>, he opened Tokyo&#x2019;s first photography studio, established Japan&#x2019;s first collotype press, and was a founding member of the Japan Photographic Society, the nation&#x2019;s first amateur photography association.<br>&#x201c;Ogawa opened his own portrait studio at the age of seventeen, launched Japan&#x2019;s first art magazine, and by 1890 was recognized as the foremost photography publisher in Japan.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Botanic Garden</i></p><h2>The House of Mirth (Bantam Classics)</h2><p>An immensely popular bestseller upon its publication in 1905, <b>The House of Mirth</b> was Edith Wharton&#x2019;s first great novel. Set among the elegant brownstones of New York City and opulent country houses like gracious Bellomont on the Hudson, the novel creates a satiric portrayal of what Wharton herself called &#x201c;a society of irresponsible pleasure-seekers&#x201d; with a precision comparable to that of Proust. And her brilliant and complex characterization of the doomed Lily Bart, whose stunning beauty and dependence on marriage for economic survival reduce her to a decorative object, becomes an incisive commentary on the nature and status of women in that society. From her tragic attraction to bachelor lawyer Lawrence Selden to her desperate relationship with social-climbing Rosedale, Lily is all too much a product of the world indicated by the title, a phrase taken from Ecclesiastes: &#x201c;The heart of fools is in the house of mirth.&#x201d; For it is Lily&#x2019;s very specialness that threatens the elegance and fulfillment she seeks in life. Along with the author&#x2019;s other masterpiece, <b>The Age of Innocence</b><i>,</i> this novel claims a place among the finest American novels of manners.</p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Tesla vs Edison: The Life-Long Feud that Electrified the World (Volume 15) (Oxford People, 15)</h2><p><p>Nikola Tesla today is largely unknown and overlooked among the great scientists of the modern era.

Over the next two decades the publication of subsequent editions under the title <i>Norske folkeeventyr</i> made the names Asbjï¿½rnsen and Moe synonymous with Norwegian storytelling traditions. Tiina Nunnally&#x2019;s vivid translation of their monumental collection is the first new English translation in more than 150 years&#x2014;and the first ever to include all sixty original tales.</p><p>Magic and myth inhabit these pages in figures both familiar and strange. Giant trolls and talking animals are everywhere. The winds take human form. A one-eyed old woman might seem reminiscent of the Norse god Odin. We meet sly aunts, resourceful princesses, and devious robbers. The clever and fearless boy Ash Lad often takes center stage as he ingeniously breaks spells and defeats enemies to win half the kingdom. These stories, set in Norway&#x2019;s majestic landscape of towering mountains and dense forests, are filled with humor, mischief, and sometimes surprisingly cruel twists of fate. All are rendered in the deceptively simple narrative style perfected by Asbjï¿½rnsen and Moe&#x2014;now translated into an English that is as finely tuned to the modern ear as it is true to the original Norwegian.</p><p>Included here&#x2014;for the very first time in English&#x2014;are Asbjï¿½rnsen and Moe&#x2019;s Forewords and Introductions to the early Norwegian editions of the tales. Asbjï¿½rnsen gives us an intriguing glimpse into the actual collection process and describes how the stories were initially received, both in Norway and abroad. Equally fascinating are Moe&#x2019;s views on how central characters might be interpreted and his notes on the regions where each story was originally collected. Nunnally&#x2019;s informative Translator&#x2019;s Note places the tales in a biographical, historical, and literary context for the twenty-first century.</p><p>The Norwegian folktales of Asbjï¿½rnsen and Moe are timeless stories that will entertain, startle, and enthrall readers of all ages.</p><br> &nbsp;</p><p><p>Peter Christen Asbjï¿½rnsen (1812&#x2013;1885) and Jï¿½rgen Moe (1813&#x2013;1882) were energetic writers and researchers best known for their monumental collection <i>Norske folkeeventyr</i> (<i>Norwegian Folktales</i>), which introduced the lively traditions of Norwegian storytelling to readers around the world.</p><p><br> Tiina Nunnally is an award-winning translator of Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish literature.

The stories open horizons of enjoyable impossibility and are filled with the humor of resistance and a relish for the absurd. Throughout, Tiina Nunnally&#x2019;s new, pared down renderings capture limpidly that special tone of affectless matter-of-factness that readers and listeners thrill to, laughing and shivering at the same time."&#x2014;Marina Warner, author of <i>Fairy Tale: A Very Short Introduction</i>*</p><p>"In a translation as crystalline and pellucid as the waters of the fjords, Tiina Nunnally takes the stories that Asbjï¿½rnsen and Moe collected from the people of rural Norway, translates them, and gives them to us afresh. Each story feels honed, as if it were recently collected from a storyteller who knew how to tell it and who had, in turn, heard it from someone who knew how to tell it."&#x2014;Neil Gaiman, from the Foreword</p><br><br><p>"&#x2018;Asbjï¿½rnsen and Moe adopted a clear and deceptively simple narrative style that was meant to be read aloud,&#x2019; Ms. Nunnally notes. &#x2018;They used repetition and alliteration to mimic the tradition of oral storytelling.&#x2019; With a translation that retains these qualities, Norway&#x2019;s wonderfully weird traditional tales are as much a delight to the ear as they are to the imagination."&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p></p><h2>Convergence Of Probability Measures 2Ed (Pb 2014)</h2><p>The Book is brand new.Guaranteed customer satisfaction.</p><p></p><h2>Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson (Chatham River Press Classics)</h2><p><i>The Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson</i>, by <b>Emily Dickinson</b>, is part of the <i><i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

However, in her mid-twenties she began to grow reclusive, and eventually she rarely descended from her room in her father&#x2019;s house. She spent most of her time working on her poetry, largely without encouragement or real interest from her family and peers, and died at age fifty-five. Only a handful of her 1,775 poems had been published during her lifetime. When her poems finally appeared after her death, readers immediately recognized an artist whose immense depth and stylistic complexities would one day make her the most widely recognized female poet to write in the English language.<p>Dickinson&#x2019;s poetry is remarkable for its tightly controlled emotional and intellectual energy. The longest poem covers less than two pages. Yet in theme and tone her writing reaches for the sublime as it charts the landscape of the human soul. A true innovator, Dickinson experimented freely with conventional rhythm and meter, and often used dashes, off rhymes, and unusual metaphors techniques that strongly influenced modern poetry. Dickinson&#x2019;s idiosyncratic style, along with her deep resonance of thought and her observations about life and death, love and nature, and solitude and society, have firmly established her as one of America&#x2019;s true poetic geniuses.</p><p><b>Includes an index of first lines.</b><br></p></p><p>Emily Dickinson was a prolific writer and yet, with the exception of four poems in a limited regional volume, her poems were never published during her lifetime. It was indeed fortunate that her sister discovered the poems&#x2014;all loosely bound in bundles&#x2014;shortly after Dickinson died. <br><i>Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson</i> is the complete collection of the first three volumes of poetry published posthumously in 1890, 1891, and 1896 by editors Mary Loomis Todd and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. The volumes were all received with high acclaim and contain some of her best-known poems. It was in the twentieth century, however, that Dickinson was finally recognized as one of the great poets and, without dispute, the most popular. <br>The name Emily Dickinson is a legend now, but she never had the opportunity to taste the wine of success and fame in her lifetime. In fact, if there was any legendary status she received in her life, it was not for poetry but for the way she lived her life. She received local notoriety in her native town of Amherst, Massachusetts, as an eccentric recluse who, with few exceptions, would never set foot outside her house. Yet, as her poetry will attest, she had a keen insight of life, love, nature, and death and seemed to be content with her station in life.<br>Reading through the poems in <i>Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson</i>, you will see that she was indeed a woman of independence and spirit, a poet that lives today in our hearts and minds.<p><b>From Rachel Wetzsteon&#x2019;s introduction to <i>The Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson</i></b></p><p>Emily Dickinson, writing to the editor Thomas Wentworth Higginson in July 1862, reported that she had no portrait,&#x201d; but offered the following description in place of one: Small, like the Wren, and my Hair is bold, like the Chestnut Bur and my eyes, like the Sherry in the Glass, that the Guest leaves Would this do just as well?&#x201d; (<i>Selected Letters</i>, edited by Thomas H. Johnson, p. 175; see For Further Reading&#x201d;). Despite Dickinson&#x2019;s claim, we do possess one photograph of her a daguerreotype taken in 1847 or 1848, when she was in her late teens. The image certainly confirms her self-portrait: Her frame is tiny; her shiny hair does indeed sit boldly atop her head; and her dark eyes really do glisten like liquor at the bottom of a glass.</p><p>The photograph also suggests many of the rich puzzles and paradoxes that have informed our view of Dickinson since the last decade of the nineteenth century, when readers and critics began to read, study, and obsess over her poems. Dickinson&#x2019;s body, with its delicate hands and slender torso, may resemble the fragile form of someone too weak to venture far from home; but her huge moist eyes stare at us with the wisdom, depth, and longing of a woman who has traveled around the world and come back with stories, not all of them fit for mixed company. She demurely clutches a bouquet of flowers, and a book rests primly at her side; but her full, sensuous lips reveal a person whose thoughts may not always tend toward such tidy subjects as flowers and books. We look away from the photograph intrigued and stirred: What&#x2019;s going on in her mind? How could this slight figure be the author of some of the most passionate love poems, the most searing descriptions of loss, the most haunting religious lyrics ever written?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, on December 10, 1830, the middle child of Edward and Emily Norcross Dickinson; her brother, Austin, was born in 1829 and her sister, Lavinia, in 1833. Her father, a lawyer, served as treasurer of Amherst College (her grandfather was a co-founder of the college), and also occupied important positions on the General Court of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts State Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. His Heart,&#x201d; Dickinson wrote in a letter, was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists&#x201d; (<i>Letters</i>, p. 223). He was strictly religious (something she would later rebel against), leading the family prayers every day and often censoring her reading; but he also ensured that Dickinson grew up in a household surrounded by books and heated intellectual debates. Her mother was a more shadowy presence; Dickinson wrote that she does not care for thought&#x201d; (<i>Letters</i>, p. 173);<b> </b>more harshly, she claimed, I never had a mother. I suppose a mother is one to whom you hurry when you are troubled&#x201d; (<i>Letters</i>, vol. 2, p. 475).<b> </b>Even so, the Dickinsons remained an extremely close-knit family; after her brother, Austin, married, he and his wife settled right next door.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dickinson attended the coeducational Amherst Academy from the ages of ten to seventeen, and then went on to the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College) in nearby South Hadley. She blossomed there into a social and spirited young woman. The most significant event of her stay occurred at a fundamentalist Calvinist revival meeting, when she was asked to stand and declare herself a Christian and refused. After one year at Mount Holyoke she returned in 1948 to Amherst, where she remained, apart from brief trips to Boston, Cambridge, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., for the rest of her life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At school and at home, Dickinson received an excellent education. At the Amherst Academy alone she studied the arts, English literature, rhetoric, philosophy, Latin, French, German, history, geography, classics, and the Bible; she also received a firm grounding in the sciences, mathematics, geology, botany, natural history, physiology, and astronomy. At home the Dickinsons&#x2019; large and varied library included books by Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau, Longfellow, Shakespeare, Keats, the Brownings, the Brontï¿½s, and George Eliot, along with Noah Webster&#x2019;s <i>An American Dictionary of the English Language</i> which for Dickinson would prove one of the most important books of all and a healthy dose of newspapers and romance novels.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During her early twenties, Dickinson began to dress in white, to leave her house only on rare occasions, and to restrict the circle of her acquaintances until it numbered just a few people. Often speaking to visitors through a screen or from an adjoining room, she soon developed a reputation as a town eccentric. The young Mabel Loomis Todd, having recently moved to Amherst with her husband, David, remarked in a letter to her parents about a strange resident:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I must tell you about the <i>character</i> of Amherst. It is a lady whom all the people call the <i>Myth</i>. She is a sister of Mr. Dickinson, &amp; seems to be the climax of all the family oddity. She has not been outside her house in fifteen years, except once to see a new church, when she crept out at night, &amp; viewed it by moonlight. No one who calls upon her mother &amp; sister ever sees her, but she allows little children once in a great while, &amp; one at a time, to come in, when she gives them cake or candy, or some nicety, for she is very fond of little ones. But more often she lets down the sweetmeat by a string, out of a window, to them. She dresses wholly in white, &amp; her mind is said to be perfectly wonderful. She writes finely, but no one <i>ever</i> sees her. Her sister . . . invited me to come &amp; sing to her mother sometime. . . . People tell me the <i>myth</i> will hear every note she will be near, but unseen. . . . Isn&#x2019;t that like a book? So interesting (Farr, <i>Emily Dickinson: A Collection of Critical Essays</i>, p. 20).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One can hardly blame Todd for being fascinated by such an unusual character.&#x201d; But unfortunately, the myth&#x201d; she takes such pleasure in describing influenced our later notions of Dickinson much too heavily. Despite her seclusion, a large number of prominent figures came and went through her house. She also developed deep, though largely epistolary, friendships with several people: the clergyman Charles Wadsworth, whom she met in Philadelphia and described as her dearest earthly friend&#x201d;; Samuel Bowles, editor of the Springfield <i>Republican</i>; and Judge Otis Phillips Lord of Salem, Massachusetts.</p></p><h2>Computer Engineering: A DEC View of Hardware Systems Design</h2><p>This book has been written for practicing computer designers, whether their domain is microcomputers, minicomputers, or large computers.

Its aim is to guide students and general readers to an understanding of how the physical world works; physics is presented as a human endeavour, with historical development forming a thread throughout the text. The prerequisites are minimal, only basic algebra and trigonometry since the necessary calculus is developed in the text, with physics providing the motivation. New concepts are introduced at the natural, logical point with many historical references to place physics in a social perspective. Many topics from twentieth-century physics are included, for example energy, low temperature physics, relativity and black holes. The book is attractively and profusely illustrated and will be welcomed by students and also by general readers for whom this will be a stimulating alternative to other, less-thorough treatments.</p><p>This important textbook is based on, though independent of, an educational TV series.

Gerston serves as the political analyst for NBC11, a San Francisco Bay Area television station, where he appears on a regular basis. He has written more than 140 op-ed pieces for newspapers throughout the nation and speaks often on issues such as civic engagement and political empowerment.<br><br>Terry Christensen is a San Jose State University Professor Emeritus of Political Science. Among his many awards for scholarship and service to the university, he was named Outstanding Professor in 1998. He is the author or co-author of nine books. In addition to those co-authored with Larry Gerston, his works include Projecting Politics: Political Messages in American Films (with Elizabeth Haas and Peter Haas, 2015), and Local Politics: A Practical Guide to Governing at the Grassroots (with Tom Hogen-Esch, 2006). Local and national media regularly call on him for analysis of politics in California and Silicon Valley and he is the host of Valley Politics, a television show on local politics in Silicon Valley. Christensen is experienced in practical politics at the local level as an advocate of policy proposals, an adviser to grassroots groups, and an adviser and mentor to candidates for local office -- many of whom are his former students. He has served on numerous civic committees and commissions. He was the founding executive director of CommUniverCity San Jose (www.cucsj.org), a partnership between the City of San Jose, San Jose State University, and adjacent neighborhoods.

Beginning with Einstein's equation of E=mc2 as the basis of physics, the introduction in both books defines a natural law so that readers may grasp the scientific principles presented. Chapters follow a sequential and logical progression through questions and explanations of everyday occurrences, the discovery of scientific laws, and their relationships to other discoveries in the field. Terms unique to the subject of physics are clearly explained and defined, and some simple experiments provide further understanding of these laws and how they work. Straightforward drawings and diagrams show processes and the structure of elements. The language and sentence structure make an otherwise difficult subject easier to understand through a conversational text. Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Dmitri Mendeleyev are only a few of the great scientists introduced. A time line of major scientific discoveries and other major American historical events helps in placing these discoveries in historical perspective.<br><i>Susan Shaver, Hemingford Public Schools, NE </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 7-12. This latest title in the Secrets of the Universe series looks at the scientific laws that govern matter and energy. After presenting a brief definition of a natural law, Fleisher devotes each chapter to examining one law of nature, including Mendeleyev's Periodic Table, the laws of thermodynamics, and laws governing the conservation of matter and how the elements combine. Complex concepts are made accessible through the use of simple language, clear diagrams, and interesting real-life examples. The first law of thermodynamics tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed. So what happens to the heat from a steaming cup of coffee? Where does it go? A useful time line sets the science in history, and there are several short biographies of notable scientists, as well as a helpful glossary and suggestions for print and online resources. An excellent selection for preliminary research in the physical sciences, this is also a good general overview of basic principles. <i>Heather Hepler</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

In his companion Field Guide, he further explores those techniques in a practical guide. With the <i>Teach Like a Champion Field Guide</i>, teachers will have an indispensable resource that complements their classroom application of Lemov's techniques. The activities are designed to accompany the practitioner on the journey to become a champion teacher. The activities span three stages: learning the techniques, preparing to use the techniques, and actual practice.</p> <p>In addition to developing and sharpening teaching techniques, the activities provide a proven system for assessing outcomes. The book includes thirty new video clips of champion teachers with analysis from the author. It also includes helpful charts for teachers to track their own progress and to record feedback from colleagues.

The workbook is also a great tool for professional development.</p></p><p><br> <strong> Q&amp;A with Author Doug Lemov</strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author Doug Lemov</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br><strong>How does the Field Guide relate to the original <em>Teach Like a Champion</em> book? </strong><br><br>The <em>Teach Like a Champion Field Guide</em> offers teachers a pragmatic guide for mastering the techniques profiled in the original <em>Teach Like a Champion</em>. Learning about the techniques used by effective teachers is a first step in the process of harnessing a teacher&#x2019;s potential. In my role as managing director at Uncommon Schools I&#x2019;ve found that teachers need to practice, to road test new techniques, to get feedback, and to try again. They also need to reflect upon areas to target for development. This Field Guide is designed to help teachers do just that. <br><br>With this book teachers will be able to find and strengthen their signature skills. It&#x2019;s true that no champion teacher is without weaknesses, even those who take our collective breath away. What champions have in common is a portfolio of five or six skills at which they excel. Of course the skills aren&#x2019;t the same ones for every teacher&#x2014;the combinations are as unique as the applications. But it&#x2019;s these skills that drive much of their success. The lesson from this is: strengthen your strengths as much as your weaker areas, make your strengths exceptional, even while you broaden the range of areas where you have mastery. <br><br><strong>Where should teachers and instructional leaders begin their work with the techniques? </strong><br><br>Given that there are 49 techniques I&#x2019;m frequently asked, Where to start? <br><br>Every teacher and facilitator will approach this question differently. The way you move through the book and use it to enhance your teaching practice will be as individual as you are. Still, here are some initial thoughts: <br><br>If you wanted to begin with the two techniques that were most likely to revolutionize what I call &#x201c;the culture of academic expectations&#x201d; then I&#x2019;d suggest you choose Cold Call and No Opt Out. But I realize not all teachers are looking for this kind of revolution as a starting point. In fact some of the best teachers argue that great classrooms rest on a culture of strong everyday routines that give teachers the power to teach efficiently and students the power to excel. These kinds of routines often free up astounding amounts of time for teaching. So, for many teachers starting with the techniques such as Entry Routine and Tight Transitions, in Section Five, numbers 28 through 35, makes a lot of sense. Another possible place to begin is with planning techniques such as Begin with the End and Double Plan. I hope you find that wherever you begin your work, the <em>Teach Like a Champion Field Guide</em> will help you make a strong start and sustain your practice.<p>In his acclaimed book, Teach Like a Champion, Doug Lemov shared 49 techniques that are essential to the art of teaching.</p> <p>In this Field Guide he shows how to implement, customize, and master those techniques in practice.</p> <p>The activities are designed to help teachers reflect, self-assess, and discover what techniques are most valuable to them. Teachers may evaluate their comfort and confidence in using the 49 techniques, easily compare notes with fellow teachers, and maintain a record of progress.

Do we read and study the Bible enough? Do we worship often and in the right way? Do we pray enough, in the correct way, and for the right things? How do we become truly spiritual? And the answers from numerous self-help spirituality books only lead to confusion and the fear of missing key steps on the road to becoming spiritual. In response, John W. Kleinig clarifies that there is no process for becoming spiritual. Instead, God graciously gives to us every spiritual gift that we need, beginning with the very gift of faith in Christ, our Savior. Because God has joined us to Christ, He continually comes to give us life.</p><p></p><h2>Don Quijote de la Mancha I + CD (Leer en Espanol: Level 3) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>In this first part, seated upon his lean nag of a horse, and accompanied by the pragmatic Sancho Panza, Don Quixote rides the roads of Spain where hostels become castles, herds become armies, and windmills become giants.</p><p></p><h2>Finding the Walls of Troy: Frank Calvert and Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlik</h2><p>The relentlessly self-promoting amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann took full credit for discovering Homer's Troy over one hundred years ago, and since then generations have thrilled to the tale of his ambitions and achievements. But Schliemann gained this status as an archaeological hero partly by deliberately eclipsing the man who had launched his career. Now, at long last, Susan Heuck Allen puts the record straight in this fascinating archaeological adventure that restores the British expatriate Frank Calvert to his rightful place in the story of the identification and excavation of Hisarlï¿½k, the site now thought to be Troy as described in the <i>Iliad</i>.<br><br>Frank Calvert had lived in the Troad&#x2014;in the northwest corner of Asia Minor&#x2014;excavating there for fifteen years before Schliemann arrived and learning the local topography well. He was the first archaeologist to test the hypothesis that Hisarlï¿½k was the Troy of Hector and Helen. So that he would have unrestricted access to the site, he purchased part of the mound and was the first archaeologist to conduct excavations there. Running out of funds, he later interested Schliemann in the site. The thankless Schliemann stole Calvert's ideas, exploited his knowledge and advice, and finally stole Calvert's glory, in part by slandering him and denigrating his work. Allen corrects the record and does justice to a man who was a victim of his own integrity while giving a balanced treatment of Schliemann's true accomplishments.<br><br>This meticulously researched book tells the story of Frank Calvert's development as an archaeologist, his adventures and discoveries. It focuses on the twists and turns of his turbulent relationship with the perfidious Schliemann, the resulting gains for archaeology, and the successful conclusion of their common quest. Allen has brought together a wide range of relevant published material as well as unpublished sources from archives, diaries, letters, and personal interviews to tell this gripping story.</p><p>"Allen sets into print the story of Frank Calvert, the man really responsible for the discovery of Hisarlik and its identification with ancient Troy. . . . This book presents both new and little-known material and is fascinating in its treatment of Calvert and Schliemann."&#x2014;Eric Cline, Xavier University<br><br>"In an informative and carefully documented study, Allen has restored an unjustly neglected pioneer of field archaeology to his rightful place in the discipline. She has also cast much revealing light on the most famous and controversial of modern archaeologists, Heinrich Schliemann."&#x2014;William M.

The remarkable discovery recently of a considerable number of letters and sermons by Augustine has thrown fresh light on the first and last decades of his experience as a bishop. These circumstantial texts have led Peter Brown to reconsider some of his judgments on Augustine, both as the author of the <i>Confessions</i> and as the elderly bishop preaching and writing in the last years of Roman rule in north Africa. Brown's reflections on the significance of these exciting new documents are contained in two chapters of a substantial Epilogue to his biography (the text of which is unaltered). He also reviews the changes in scholarship about Augustine since the 1960s. A personal as well as a scholarly fascination infuse the book-length epilogue and notes that Brown has added to his acclaimed portrait of the bishop of Hippo.</p><p><b>Peter Brown</b> is Rollins Professor of History at Princeton University.

In <i>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Hinduism</i>, Johnsen covers the history, philosophy, devotions, gods, and traditions of this timeless religion. She takes pains to not only make the material easy to read and understand but to get inside the minds of Hindus, themselves, to make sense of what they believe and why. This sympathetic view is balanced by objective and concrete reporting. For example, she presents discussions of the Aryan Invasion theory, whether Jesus visited India, and a well-documented case of modern-day reincarnation. In addition to introducing each of the different strains of Hinduism and their beliefs, she also gives an overview of the classic Hindu myths. Exotic, yes, but Johnsen succeeds in bringing Hinduism closer to home. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><p> Linda Johnsen holds a Master's degree in Eastern studies. She is author of Daughters of the Goddess: The Women Saints of India (winner of the Midwest Book Association Award for Best New Age Book of the Year), The Living Goddess: Reclaiming the Tradition of the Mother of the Universe, and Meditation Is Boring?

Yet Gilliam's contributions to art history extend far beyond these often monumental and always dramatic works. In this volume, the first in-depth book devoted to this major figure, Corcoran Gallery of Art Curator of Contemporary Art Jonathan P. Binstock explores four decades of work and establishes the artist&#x2019;s place in the history of post-1960s art. Binstock&#x2019;s wide-ranging and provocative inquiry into Gilliam&#x2019;s groundbreaking achievements as a modernist and as an African American artist is supported with a wealth of beautifully produced illustrations both full-color and black-and-white as well as an annotated and illustrated chronology and an exhaustive bibliography. This thoughtful exploration and appraisal of Gilliam&#x2019;s extraordinary oeuvre places the artist at the forefront of American abstract art.<br><br><i>Copub: Corcoran Gallery of Art </i></p><p>A fresh, intelligent, and insightful assessment of Sam Gilliam's lifetime achievements as an artist.

Maurice Berger, Fellow, The Vera List Center for Art &amp; Politics, The New School<br><br>"Finally a comprehensive study of one of our most significant artists! Jonathan Binstock's erudite account of Sam Gilliam's innovations in the world of art fills a considerable void in our understanding of painterly abstraction. The art works themselves-cerebral, sentient, and fascinating-consummate the inquiry and make this book a visual delight." Richard J. Powell, John Spencer Bassett Professor of Art and Art History, Duke University<br><br>"Binstock's writings on Sam Gilliam's art over the past four decades have placed the artist in the forefront of contemporary American art.

Driskell, author of Two Centuries of Black American Art<br><br>"This comprehensive text celebrates one of America's hidden national treasures.

Highly recommended. (Vaughn M.

The evidence is that she often paused to improve upon life, which in the two years, spent mostly in Paris, covered in this volume, consisted largely of cadging from her complaisant banker husband, Hugh Guiler, to support her lovers. One was the gaunt, bald sexual athlete and expatriate novelist, Henry Miller, who by then had parted from his wife, June. Another was the swarthy Communist activist Gonzalo More, whose appetite for sex overwhelmed his passion for politics, and whose slovenly wife encouraged his income-producing infidelity. Nin betrayed all three men, even on days (and nights) when she bedded them all. In her middle 30s, her erotomania left her little time for much else, but she managed to write pornographic (and then censorable) short fiction and reams of what later skeptics called a "liary." She was "a true Catholic," More told her. "You love the sin and absolution and regrets and sinning again." Yet she had few regrets but the unpublishability of her diaries. Her love seems entirely narcissistic in the manuscript volumes she filled over 52 years. But even so, her literary talent and the sensual intensity of her emotional life sets some of the pages in her diaries on fire. The first extracts, published in 1966 at age 63, established her (although she edited out some sensitive matter) as a cult figure. Since her death, Pole has been releasing the original diaries, Nearer the Moon, encompassing volumes 53 through 60. "I dream, I kiss, I have orgasms, I get exalted, I leave the world, I float, I cook, I sew, I have nightmares, I follow a gigantic creative plan," she claims. Her self-description says it all. One would hardly know that Nin was living in a France on the brink of war.

This time the players are Henry (Miller, still) and Gonzalo Mor&#x201a;, a passionate Peruvian, in a d&#x201a;doublement on which Nin positively mainlines, intoxicated by the audacity and the risk of keeping them both (and keeping them apart from each other . . . and the others). Keep them she does, on a seemingly endless shoestring provided by cipher-husband Hugh Guiler, and also by their various consorts (mostly Art in Miller's case, Communism and Helba [platonic by now] in Gonzalo's). ``I nurture their egotism,'' Nin interprets grandly, though she doesn't shrink from cataloguing her outlay of francs-per-month-per-man for food and rent. Her vague dream-picaresque purveys little actual narrative; Nin writes to evade the demons of solitude, in swirls of preoccupation with herself in all of her sacrificial, sensual, and poetic wonder (``I know I have as great an ear for nuances as Proust . . .''). Jealousy--of her lovers' lovers, past and prospective--is the ``disease'' she admits to, however, as she communes with her diary. Breathlessly: ``I feel a malaise until I write certain things down. . . . Deliverance!''

For centuries, men and women have striven to chronicle and categorize the expressions of the English language, and Samuel Johnson is usually thought to be their original predecessor. But that lineage is wrong: Robert Cawdrey published his <i>Table Alphabeticall</i> in 1604, 149 years before Johnson&#x2019;s tome, and it is now republished here for the first time in over 350 years.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This edition, prepared from the sole surviving copy of the first printing, documents Cawdrey&#x2019;s fascinating selection of 2,543 words and their first-ever definitions. Cawdrey subtitled his dictionary &#x201c;for the benefit of Ladies, Gentlewomen, and other unskilled folk,&#x201d; for his aim was not to create a comprehensive catalog, but rather an in-depth guide for the lesser educated who might not know the &#x201c;hard usual English wordes, borrowed from the Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, or French.&#x201d; Each entry reveals an intriguing facet of early modern life and the cultural mores of the time.

Previously, no-one had imagined what today seems so blindingly obvious, that a dictionary should run seamlessly, from A to Z.

One word after another amuses you, bewilders you, and astonishes you.

It may not provide much 'clavicorde' ('mirth') and it certainly 'maffles' ('stammers'), but it also 'inchaunts' ('bewitches'). It shows the raw stuff out of which Shakespeare and Cawdrey's other contemporaries of genius fashioned their more sublime flights.

It embraces the whole basin of the Amargosa from the Panamints to the Spring Mountains, from the Palmettos to the Avawatz. And it spans a century from the earliest recollections and the oldest records to that day in 1933 when much of the valley was finally set aside as a National Monument.&nbsp;This is the story of an illusory land, of the people it attracted and of the dreams and delusions they pursued-the story of the metals in its mountains and the salts in its sinks, of its desiccating heat and its revitalizing springs, and of all the riches of its scenery and lore-the story of Indians and horse thieves, lost argonauts and lost mine hunters, prospectors and promoters, miners and millionaires, stockholders and stock sharps, homesteaders and hermits, writers and tourists.&nbsp;But mostly this is the story of the illusions-the illusions of a shortcut to the gold diggings that lured the forty-niners, of inescapable deadliness that hung in the name they left behind, of lost bonanzas that grew out of the few nuggets they found, of immeasurable riches spread by hopeful prospectors and calculating con men, and of impenetrable mysteries concocted by the likes of Scotty. These and many lesser illusions are the heart of its history.</p><p>"A definitive piece of Western history . . . thorough, judicious and consistently entertaining."--Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;"Death Valley is a wilderness of extremes--the lowest, the driest, the hottest--and not surprisingly, its human history representes one more extreme, a bumptious, sleazy, hilarious Wild West Show of horse raiders, swindlers, drunks, explorers, prospectors, madmen and other such types as blast about from one outermost fringe to another."--Mark Muro, <i>The Boston Globe</i>Richard E.

She believes she is breathtakingly ugly. Tormented by what she sees as her huge nose, crooked lip, big jaw, fat buttocks, and tiny breasts, she has not left her house in six years. Though she lives in the same house as her mother, she once went two years without seeing her. When relatives come over, she avoids them, staying up on the third floor of the house, even on Thanksgiving. The one time she left the house--forced to see a doctor--she covered her face with bandages. Eventually, she attempted suicide. "I can't imagine any suffering greater than this. If I had a choice, I'd rather be blind or have my arms cut off. I'd be happy to have cancer."<br> Jane has body dysmorphic disorder, or BDD. In <em>The Broken Mirror</em>, Dr. Katharine Phillips draws on years of clinical practice and detailed interviews with over 200 patients to bring readers the first book on this debilitating disease, in which sufferers are obsessed by perceived flaws in their appearance. Phillips describes severe cases, such as Jane's, but also a multitude of milder cases, such as Carl, a successful lawyer who uses his work to distract him from his supposedly thinning hair, yet says that he thinks about it constantly. Many sufferers are able to function very well in society, but remain secretly obsessed by their "hideous acne" or "horrible nose," sneaking constant peeks at a pocket mirror, or spend hours at a time redoing makeup. According to Phillips' research, BDD afflicts approximately 2% of the population, or nearly 5 million people. It is not an uncommon disorder, simply a hidden one, since sufferers are often embarrassed to tell even their closest friends about their concerns: one woman, after fifty years of marriage, still felt too uncomfortable to reveal her preoccupation to her husband.<br> Besides the fascinating story of the disease itself, <em>The Broken Mirror</em> is also a literally lifesaving handbook for sufferers, their families, and their doctors. Left untreated, the torment of BDD can lead to psychiatric hospitalization and sometimes suicide. With treatment, many sufferers are able to lead normal lives. Phillips provides a quick self-assessment questionnaire, helping readers distinguish between normal concern with appearance and the obsession of BDD to determine whether they or someone they know have BDD. She includes warning signs for dermatologists and plastic surgeons, since they are the medical professionals who see BDD sufferers most often as they continually seek to "fix" their looks. Other chapters outline effective treatments for BDD using drugs and cognitive-behavioral therapy, answering often-asked questions about treatments. Finally, Phillips includes a chapter aimed at the friends and families of BDD sufferers. Profoundly affected by the disease themselves, since sufferers often refuse to attend weddings and other family events, or constantly ask loved ones for reassurance about their looks, those who care about someone with BDD will find both helpful advice and reassurance in this indispensable book.<br> <em>The Broken Mirror</em>--the first book on this underrecognized disorder--is essential reading for the psychiatrists, mental health professionals, and other physicians who see these often undiagnosed patients; for the friends and family concerned and upset by a loved one who won't believe their reassurances; and for the millions who suffer from BDD in silence and secrecy.</p><p><br><strong>Katharine A.

She is internationally known for her pioneering work on BDD.<br><br>"If one thinks that BDD might simply be a new age coinage for vanity, Phillips...makes a convincing case for taking a second look by drawing on years of clinical practice, research, and patient interviews."--<em>Book News</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Laughter in Ancient Rome: On Joking, Tickling, and Cracking Up (Volume 71) (Sather Classical Lectures)</h2><p>What made the Romans laugh? Was ancient Rome a carnival, filled with practical jokes and hearty chuckles?

She lives in Philadelphia.One<br> Scaring the Mundanes<br> &nbsp;<br> Klingon speakers, those who have devoted themselves to the study of a language invented for the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise, inhabit the lowest possible rung on the geek ladder. Dungeons &amp; Dragons players, ham radio operators, robot engineers, computer programmers, comic book collectors&#x2014;they all look down on Klingon speakers. Even the most ardent <i>Star Trek</i> fanatics, the Trekkies, who dress up in costume every day, who can recite scripts of entire episodes, who collect <i>Star Trek</i> paraphernalia with mad devotion, consider Klingon speakers beneath them. When a discussion of Klingon appeared on Slashdot.org&#x2014;the Web site billed as &#x201c;News for Nerds&#x201d;&#x2014;the topic inspired comments like &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry but it&#x2019;s people like this that give science fiction a bad name.&#x201d; Another said that Klingon speakers &#x201c;provide excellent reasons for forced sterilization. Then again being able to speak Klingon pretty much does this without surgery.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mark Shoulson, who has a wife and two children, doesn&#x2019;t enjoy being talked about this way. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay to laugh about it, because it&#x2019;s funny. It&#x2019;s legitimate to laugh. Klingon has entertainment as part of its face value. But I do get annoyed at some of the ruder stuff.&#x201d; Mark was my unoffi cial guide to the world of Kling on. When I met him, we lived in the same New Jersey town. I discovered this browsing the Internet, where I also found that he was assistant director of the Klingon Language Institute (KLI) and editor of the Klingon translation of <i>Hamlet</i>. I wrote him, and he e- mailed me back the same day, saying he was so excited by the prospect of another Klingon speaker so close by that he didn&#x2019;t even fi nish reading my message before he responded.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t yet a Klingon speaker, and I wasn&#x2019;t really planning on becoming one. I was a linguist who had developed a side interest in the subject of artifi cial languages, and I wanted to talk to Mark for research purposes. People really spoke Klingon&#x2014;so claimed the Klingon Language Institute materials anyway&#x2014;and I wasn&#x2019;t sure what that meant. When people &#x201c;spoke&#x201d; Klingon, was it playacting? Spitting out little words and phrases and putting on a show? A charades- like guessing game where someone sort of cobbled together a message and someone else sort of understood it? Or was it actual language use?<br> &nbsp;<br> If it was the latter, then this was something I needed to see for myself, because that would make Klingon something so remarkable as to be almost unheard of&#x2014;a consciously invented language that had been brought to life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although we like to call language mankind&#x2019;s greatest invention, it wasn&#x2019;t invented at all. The languages we speak were not created according to any plan or design. Who invented French? Who invented Portuguese? No one. They just happened. They arose. Someone said something a certain way, someone else picked up on it, and someone else embellished. A tendency turned into a habit, and somewhere along the way a system came to be. This is how pidgins, slangs, and dialects are born; this is the way English, Russian, and Japanese were born. This is the way all natural languages are born&#x2014;organically, spontaneously.<br> &nbsp;<br> The variety of shape, pattern, and color found in the languages of the world is a testament to the wonder of nature, to the breathtaking array of possibilities that can emerge, tangled and wild, from the fertile human endowments of brain and larynx, intelligence and social skills. The job of the linguist, like that of the biologist or the botanist, is not to tell us how nature should behave, or what its creations should look like, but to describe those creations in all their messy glory and try to fi gure out what they can teach us about life, the world, and, especially in the case of linguistics, the workings of the human mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> In libraries organized according to the Library of Congress call number system, linguists can usually be found in the stacks classifi ed in the fi rst half of the Ps, anywhere from subclass P, which covers general linguistics, to subclass PN, where &#x201c;literature&#x201d; starts. When I was in graduate school, I used to wander this territory, in a procrastinatory haze, noting how the languages covered by the intervening categories became more and more &#x201c;exotic&#x201d; the farther I got from PA (Greek and Latin). I would fi rst pass through aisles and aisles of Romance languages, then Germanic, Scandinavian, English, Slavic. There at the end of the Slavic section, at PG9501, things would start to get interesting, with Albanian, followed by the offerings of PH&#x2014;the Finno- Ugrics (Veps, Estonian, Udmurt, Hungarian), the mysterious Basque. By the time I got to PL, I would be far from Europe, drifting through Asia and Africa, lingering over <i>A Grammar of the Hoava Language</i>, <i>Western Solomons</i> or <i>The Southern Bauchi Group of Chadic Languages: A Survey Report</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> The final subclass, PM, was a tour through the New World, starting with the Eskimo languages of Greenland and Alaska and proceeding southward through Tlingit, Kickapoo, and Navajo to the Mayan and Aztecan languages of Mexico and Central America, down across the Amazon, through the Andes and the plains of Brazil, until I reached the islands off the southernmost tip of South America with <i>Yï¿½mana- English: A Dictionary of the Speech of Tierra del Fuego</i>. From there, there was nowhere to go but to the borders of language itself&#x2014;the contact, or &#x201c;mixed,&#x201d; languages, the pidgins and creoles of the PM7800s: <i>Spanish Contact Vernaculars in the Philippine Islands</i>; <i>Le crï¿½ole de Breaux Bridge</i>, <i>Louisiane: ï¿½tude morphosyntaxique, textes, vocabulaire.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> At the very end of this lush orchid garden of languages there was one more section, where linguists don&#x2019;t generally care to visit&#x2014;a few lonely shelves of faded plastic fl owers, the artifi cial languages. <i>The Klingon Dictionary</i> was here, among other books on languages I had never heard of: Babm, aUI, Nal Bino, Leno GiNasu, Tutonish, Ehmay Ghee Chah. These were not lighthearted language games, like pig Latin, or the spontaneous results of ingroup communication, like Cockney rhyming slang or surfer jargon. They were invented on purpose, cut from whole cloth, set down on paper, start to fi nish, by one person. They had chapters and chapters of grammar and extensive dictionaries. They were testaments not to the wonder of nature but to the human impulse to master nature. They were deliberate, painstakingly crafted attempts to tame language by making it more orderly, more rational, less burdened with inconsistencies and irregularities. There were hundreds of them. And they were all failures, dead in the water, spoken by no one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, of course they were. If you plant a plastic flower, will it grow? So I was skeptical about the claims that Klingon&#x2014;Klingon?&#x2014; had really defied the odds and sprouted roots. In the name of research, I registered for the annual Klingon conference, or qep&#x2019;a&#x2019;, to occur in Phoenix at the end of the summer. I wanted to be prepared, and so I arranged to meet with Mark.<br> &nbsp;<br> For our fi rst meeting Mark showed up in a T- shirt with the International Phonetic Alphabet printed on it, and I soon discovered that all his T- shirts were a form of self- expression. In fact, everything he owns somehow advertises his interests to the world. On his minivan he has a KLI license plate holder and an LNX sticker (proclaiming himself a user of the Linux operating system). On the vest he wears most days, he displays his three Klingon certification pins; membership pins for the Dozenal Society (&#x201c;they advocate switching to a base 12 system from the base 10 system we use for numbering&#x201d;), Mensa (&#x201c;it&#x2019;s a way for insecure people to feel better about themselves&#x201d;), and the Triple Nine Society (&#x201c;a more extreme kind of Mensa&#x201d;); and a button he made that says &#x201c;If you can read this you are standing too close&#x201d; in Braille.<br> &nbsp;<br> I usually met with Mark at a kosher pizza place. He&#x2019;s an Orthodox Jew who follows all the rules, but jokes that he would be an atheist &#x201c;if I weren&#x2019;t such a scaredy- cat.&#x201d; He is slender and jittery, one knee constantly bouncing as he talks in a speedy patter. His eyes convey both friendliness and sadness, as if he hopes you will like him but wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if you punched him. He never finished his Ph.D. in computer science, and he has had trouble holding down a job, to which he credits his attention deficit disorder (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not an excuse; it&#x2019;s an explanation&#x201d;). He cares for his children while his wife, a physician, works, and he teaches computer programming part- time at a yeshiva in Newark. While many bright people like Mark tend to blame the world for not rewarding them more heartily for their smarts, he accepts his own responsibility in the matter. He knows a lot, but not much of it is career making. He is, as he might put it, a polymath of esoterica. His other interests include knot making, typography, mathematical knitting, and calendrical systems. We flew to Phoenix together, and when the plane took off, he pulled a book out of his duffel bag titled <i>Science from Your Airplane Window</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The European Colonial Empires: 1815-1919</h2><p><p>The nineteenth century was Europe's colonial century.

The war has ended, but for Blam the town is haunted with its presence, and memories of its dead: Aaron Grï¿½n, the hunchbacked watchmaker; Eduard Fiker, a lamp merchant; Jakob Mentele, a stove fitter; Arthur Spitzer, a grocer who played amateur soccer and had non-Jewish friends; and Sï¿½ndor Vï¿½rtes, a communist lawyer. They stand before him as ever, but they are only the ghosts in Blam's mind. Accompanying the others are Blam's family and his best friend, all of whom perished in the infamous Novi Sad raid in January 1942. Blam lives. He seeks no revenge, no retribution. His life is a spectator's-made all the more agonizing by the clarity with which he sees the events around him. The silhouettes of the dead pass before him, and he incorporates what would have been their daily lives into his own. And in telling the story of one man's life after the war, Ti<br></p><p>The Balkans: a seething cauldron of centuries-old racial hatreds and periodic massacres perpetrated by one ethnic group upon another. The newspapers fill with one atrocity after another, and eventually the mind and heart numbs to the sufferings of whichever unlucky group is being victimized this time. Perhaps the only way to truly appreciate the horror of the tragedy is to scale it down from the general to the specific, from the anguish of the many to the agony of one. This is the approach Aleksandar Tï¿½sma takes in <i>The Book of Blam</i>, originally published in 1972. Set in post-World War II Yugoslavia, in the city of Novi Sad, the novel chronicles the despair of Miroslav Blam, the only member of his family to survive an infamous Hungarian slaughter of Jews and Serbs on the banks of the Danube in 1942. <p> Blam survived the roundup only because a traitorous journalist who was once his mother's lover vouched for him with the Hungarians. Now it is after the war, and though Novi Sad has seemingly returned to normal, Blam is beset by the ghosts of those he has outlived. As he walks the streets of his city and goes through the motions of his life, he remembers the woman he loved, the friends he lost, and his own failure to "face the rifle barrels like his father and mother, the search patrols like his sister, Estera; he has failed to go down to the Danube like Slobodan Krkljus and bend over an old man on the ground, deaf to all warning and moved only by the thought of the moment, the thought of assistance. He had seen nothing, learned nothing." Tï¿½sma offers neither consolation nor redemption for his protagonist. Instead, Blam is left only with the hollow expectation of a future war in which he will, at last, be able to make the supreme sacrifice, thus "committing an act of the most profound truth," while the reader is left with the uncomfortable realization that in a world riven by sectarian violence, Blam's tragedy is not unique. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>ALEKSANDAR TISMA was born in 1924 in Vojvodina, Yugoslavia, to a Serbian father and a Hungarian mother. He experienced the Holocaust in his native town of Novi Sad. After the war he worked as a journalist in Novi Sad and Belgrade, and later became an editor, writer, and translator. He has written sixteen works of fiction, of which the last five--what he calls a pentateuch of novels and stories--have been devoted to the subject of the Holocaust.</p><h2>From Chocolate to Morphine: Everything You Need to Know About Mind-Altering Drugs</h2><p>Drugs are as pervasive as ever, and parents and children alike need complete, unbiased information about how drugs affect the mind and the body. Weil and Rosen cover a wide range of available substances, from coffee to marijuana, from antihistamines to psychedelics, from steroids to the new &#34;smart drugs.&#34;</p><p>Winifred Rosen was raised and educated in New York City, where for several years she taught high school English and literature. She then began writing books for children and young adults. Her titles include <i>Henrietta, the Wild Woman of Borneo</i> (a Newbery Award nominee); <i>Cruisin for a Bruisin;</i> and <i>Three Romances: Love Stories from Camelot Retold</i>. She now lives on Long Island, where she divides her time between writing and landscape gardening. <br>Since drug use has occurred throughout history and within most cultures, the authors in this updated edition of their original work ( LJ 3/15/83) believe that "education based on truthful information is the only solution to the drug problem." In straightforward language, Weil and Rosen distinguish between drug use and drug abuse and stress the importance of developing a "good relationship" with drugs. Because the authors do not condemn drug use (legal or illegal), their volume may be considered unorthodox by some. Each chapter deals with a specific class of drugs, such as stimulants, depressants, and psychedelics, and describes the different effects of drugs in each category. At the end of each chapter are some precautions for using those drugs and also suggested readings for more information. Aimed at young people and their parents and teachers, this book offers an alternative way of looking at drug use.

Kevin Bales's disturbing story of contemporary slavery reaches from Pakistan's brick kilns and Thailand's brothels to various multinational corporations. His investigations reveal how the tragic emergence of a "new slavery" is inextricably linked to the global economy. This completely revised edition includes a new preface.<br><br>All of the author's royalties from this book go to fund antislavery projects around the world.<br><br></p><p>The horror of slavery, says Kevin Bales, is "not confined to history." It is not only possible that slave labor is responsible for the shoes on your feet or your daily consumption of sugar, he writes, the products of forced labor filter even more quietly into a broad portion of daily Western life. "They made the bricks for the factory that made the TV you watch. In Brazil slaves made the charcoal that tempered the steel that made the springs in your car and the blade on your lawnmower.... Slaves keep your costs low and returns on your investments high."<p> The exhaustive research in <i>Disposable People</i> shows that at least 27 million people are currently enslaved around the world. Bales, considered the world's leading expert on contemporary slavery, reveals the historical and economic conditions behind this resurgence. From Thailand, Mauritania, Brazil, Pakistan, and India, Bales has gathered stories of people in unthinkable conditions, kept in bondage to support their owners' lives. Bales insists that even a small effort from a large number of people could end slavery, and devotes a large chapter to explaining the practical means by which this might be accomplished. "Are we willing to live in a world with slaves?" he asks. As a sign of his commitment, all his royalties from <i>Disposable People</i> will go toward the fight against slavery. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>&#34;A well-researched, scholarly, and deeply disturbing exposï¿½ of modern-day slavery with well-thought-out strategies for what to do to combat this scourge.

It concludes the late Arthur Marder's two-volume history of the Royal Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy in the decisive years of 1936-1945. Volume II picks up the story at the nadir of the British naval fortunes, and follows the Royal Navy from its position in 1942 to its role in the Japanese surrender in August 1945. The book offers a critical assessment of Churchill's role in shaping the British war effort; the role of the HMS<em>Exeter</em>; the work of Sir James Somerville, who attempted to train his motley fleet of castoffs into an efficient force able to safeguard trade in the Indian Ocean against Axis raiders and submarines; and the events leading up to the Battle of the Java Sea.

Prone to fantasy and unruffled by inconsistency, preschool children are frequently baffled by the first lessons of early schooling. Trained to gently resist the child&#x2019;s illogic, teachers sometimes create just the incomprehension and anxiety they mean to avoid. In <i>Wally&#x2019;s Stories</i>, Vivian Paley shows that none of this need be so.</p><p><i>Wally&#x2019;s Stories</i> is itself a story: the story of the evolution of a kindergarten classroom in which Paley learned to stop fighting childish fantasy and instead make use of it to stimulate the very best brand of thinking her five-year-olds can muster. Stories also lie at the heart of her classroom: stories that are first told by one of the children, then transcribed by the teacher, and then acted out by the class in dramatic productions of their own design. Paley shows that in the course of creating their own dramatic world, five-year-olds are capable of thought and language far in advance of what they accomplish in traditional classroom exercises. The children&#x2019;s stories also become a vehicle that they can use to explain themselves to their teacher and to one another. Together, teacher and children develop an unusual environment, one that is logical and literate, based on rules of fairness, friendship, and fantasy.</p><p>Vivian Paley&#x2019;s book is as refreshing as her teaching method&#x2015;a new kind of book about a new kind of classroom.</p></p><p>&#39;This remarkable book is delightful to read and rewarding to ponder.

He lives in Los Angeles, California.&#x201c;<em>Why Therapy Works</em> is a tour de force. Too often today the public thinks that one can read a book or watch a documentary and be transformed psychologically. Unfortunately, that is not how the human mind works. Humans require other minds for change and change is hard. We are &#x2018;embodied and embedded&#x2019; in an interpersonal matrix. To understand the human experience and create change, we must move from a single-skull understanding to an intersubjective context of two or more minds. Louis Cozolino explains this phenomenon in a manner easy to digest, taking the reader from the evolutionary heritage of human psychology to an understanding of the experience of psychotherapy applied in common clinical circumstances.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Drew Pinsky, MD, Internist/Addictionologist and Host of Dr. Drew on HLN</strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] wonderful read. . . .

In terms of accessibility, the book is a quick read that covers a lot of ground in a short space.

I applaud Professor Dershowitz for his consistent, principled, and reasoned defense of Israel, and, so, of the Jewish people." &#x2014;David Mamet <p> "In a world in which Israel seems always to be the accused, regardless of the facts, Alan Dershowitz's defense offers an oasis of sanity and straight talk. It may be too much to hope that Israel's accusers will read this powerful and persuasive response to their charges. It is not at all too much to ask that fair-minded observers do so." &#x2014;Floyd Abrams </p><p> "Alan Dershowitz's detailed and penetrating analysis of the issues that fuel the continuing war in Israel should be read by everyone interested in reaching a fair conclusion as to how that tragic conflict should be ended. Every charge leveled by Israel's opponents is dealt with lucidly and convincingly by one of the nation's brightest minds and most effective advocates." &#x2014;Mario M. Cuomo </p><p> "This is a powerful and brilliantly argued book by a life- long champion of law, freedom, and human rights. Dershowitz faces down the Big Lies one by one and proves that Israel is not guilty of colonialism, apartheid, or "Nazism." Anyone who cares about Israel&#x2014;and about the truth&#x2014;will find this essential, even life-saving reading." &#x2014;Phyllis Chesler Ph.D, author of <i>The New Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis and What We Can Do About It</i> </p><p> "In this important book, as in many of his writings, Alan Dershowitz remains an ardent and courageous defender of Israel and what the law stands for." &#x2014;Elie Wiesel </p><p> "The Case for Israel is a marvelous primer for supporters of that beleaguered state who want to d efend Israel from the calamities falsely ascribed to it by its worldwide enemies. Dershowitz has summarized those false accusations and provided the facts, enabling the reader to respond to the anti-Semites and those who are hostile to Israel. More than a great read, it is essential if you want to be equipped to defend Israel in the world of conversation and debate." &#x2014;Edward I. Koch </p><p> "<i>The Case for Israel</i> is indispensable reading for those of us who are deeply disturbed by the rise of anti-Semitism in American society, even on college campuses." --Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Chairman, Department of African and African-American Studies at Harvard</p>Even as Israel boldly offers statehood to Palestinians in exchange for an enduring peace, many academics and activists&#x2013;primarily but not exclusively from the hard left&#x2013;have gone on the attack against Israel, deriding it as an imperialist power bent on oppressing the Palestinians. On prominent campuses across the United States and throughout the world, petitions circulate asking universities to divest holdings in Israel and to boycott Israeli Jews without regard to their individual views. Virulent opponents of Israel have accused that democracy of unspeakable human rights abuses, while many who believe otherwise remain silent. Now, in this impassioned and closely argued book, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz sets the record straight and explains why Israel, while not perfect, is in fact the sole outpost of liberty and democracy in the Middle East&#x2013;a country that has earned the right to exist within secure boundaries and defend itself.<p>Drawing on scrupulous, unbiased research and his peerless skills as an advocate, Dershowitz conclusively refutes thirty-two separate slurs, slanders, and misrepresentations that have been hurled at Israel in recent years, including:</p><ul><li>Israel is a colonial, imperialist state</li><li>The Jews have always rejected the two-state solution</li><li>The Jews have exploited the Holocaust</li><li>Israel&#x2019;s victimization of the Palestinians has been the primary cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict</li><li>Israel created the Arab refugee problem</li><li>Israel tortures Palestinians</li><li>Israel&#x2019;s targeted assassinations of terrorist leaders are unlawful</li><li>Israel is the "prime" human rights violator in the world</li><li>Universities should divest from Israel and boycott Israeli scholars</li></ul><p>In demolishing these charges, Dershowitz documents how Israel was founded with the blessing of the United Nations&#x2013;and how it was Arabs, not Israelis, who initiated the </p><p>cycle of violence that still persists today. He proves that the division of Palestine between Israel and the Palestinians has long been accepted by Israel and rejected by most Arabs. He demonstrates why Israeli actions in the West Bank and Gaza are not motivated by territorial ambitions, but by the very real sense that Israel is under attack. And he shows how critics of Israel gloss over the terrorism, human rights abuses, and antidemocratic ideologies of other regimes in the region, substituting bigotry and veiled anti-Semitism for objective analysis. Well reasoned, hard-hitting, and provocative, The Case for Israel is essential reading for anyone who cares about Israel and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.</p></p><h2>Detection Unlimited (Country House Mysteries, 12)</h2><p><p><strong>They all wanted him dead...but which one turned hatred into murder?</strong></p><p>Slumped on a seat under an oak tree is local solicitor Sampson Warrenby, stone cold dead, with a bullet in his brain.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><b><i>From Chapter One</i></b></p> <p>Mr Thaddeus Drybeck, stepping from the neat gravel drive leading from his house on to the road, found his further progress challenged, and, indeed, impeded, by the sudden onrush of several Pekinese dogs, who bounced and barked asthmatically about his feet. Repressing a desire to sweep them from his path with the tennis-racquet he was carrying, he used this instead to guard his ankles, for one of Mrs Midgeholme's Pekes was known to bite.</p> <p>'Shoo!' said Mr Drybeck testily. 'Get away!' The Pekes, maddened to frenzy by this form of address, bounced and barked more than ever; and one of them made a dart at Mr Drybeck's racquet.</p> <p>'Peekies, Peekies!' trilled a new voice, in loving reproach. 'Naughty! Come to Mother at once! It's only their play, Mr Drybeck.'</p> <p>Three of the Pekes, feeling that the possibilities of the situation had been exhausted, abandoned their prey; the fourth, standing four-square before Mr Drybeck, continued to bark and growl at him until snatched up into the arms of her owner, who dealt her a fond slap, and said: 'Isn't she a pet? This is Mother's eldest little girl, aren't you, my treasure? Now, say you're sorry to poor Mr Drybeck!'</p> <p>Mr Drybeck, perceiving that the animal was being thrust towards him, recoiled.</p> <p>'Oh, you've hurt her feelings!' said Mrs Midgeholme, kissing the top of the Peke's head. 'Wouldn't he shake hands with you, Ursula? Never mind!'</p> <p>The expression in Ursula's indignantly bulging eyes appeared to be one of loathing rather than of hurt, but this reflection Mr Drybeck kept to himself, merely saying in his precise way: 'I fear I am not fond of dogs.'</p> <p>'I'm sure you are <i>really,' </i>said Mrs Midgeholme, unwilling to think ill of a fellow-creature. Her eyes, which, from their slight protruberance, bore a resemblance to those of her dogs, ran over him appraisingly. 'I expect you're off to the Haswells',' she said sapiently. 'You're a great tennis-player, aren't you?'</p> <p>Mr Drybeck disclaimed, but felt the description to be just. In his youth he had spent his every summer holiday competing in tournaments, and to his frequent success the row of trophies upon the mantleshelf in his diningroom bore testimony. His style of play was old-fashioned, like everything else about him, but the young men who considered him a desiccated exponent of pat-ball nevertheless found him a difficult adversary to beat. He was by profession a solicitor, the last surviving member of a firm long-established in the neighbouring town of Bellingham. He had never married, was extremely precise in all his ways, and disliked nearly every form of modern progress: a circumstance which possibly accounted for the sadly diminishing numbers of his clients. The older members of the community amongst which he had lived all his life remained faithful to him, but the younger men seemed to prefer the methods employed by his rival and <i>bï¿½te noire</i>, Mr Sampson Warrenby, an upstart of no more than fifteen years' standing in the district. Sampson Warrenby's rapidly expanding business, at first a small thorn in Mr Drybeck's flesh, was fast assuming the proportions of a menace; and since the day, just after the War ended, when he had had the bad taste to move his private residence from Bellingham to the hitherto select village of Thornden, it had become impossible for the indignant Mr Drybeck to continue to be socially unaware of his existence. He had bought a house in the lane which debouched on to the main Bellingham road at a point almost opposite Mr Drybeck's small but ancestral home.</p> <p>'Alas, <i>my </i>tennis days are over!' proclaimed Mrs Midgeholme. 'But you'll meet my Lion.'</p> <p>Mr Drybeck was unalarmed. Major Midgeholme, who had been given the name of Lionel by optimistic parents, was a shy man of retiring habits, quite cast into the shade by his kind-hearted but somewhat overpowering wife.</p> <p>'I'll walk with you as far as the corner,' pursued Mrs Midgeholme, tucking Ursula under her arm. 'Unless you mean to go by way of the lane?'</p> <p>The lane, which served the little house rented by Miss Patterdale, at the corner, and, farther down and facing the common, Mr Warrenby's residence, led, by way of a stile, to the footpath which flanked the Haswells' large garden, and ran on beside the Squire's eastern plantations to join the northern and secondary road to Bellingham. There was a gate at the bottom of the Haswells' garden, but although this would certainly have been Mr Drybeck's shortest route he would have thought it very improper to have presented himself at the house by way of a private back-gate. So he politely fell into step beside Mrs Midgeholme, and accompanied her down the road to where the main village street intersected it. Since the Pekes had to be continually admonished, conversation was of a desultory nature. Mr Drybeck, wincing at his companion's frequent shrieks to Umbrella, Umberto, and Uppish, was forced to remind himself, not for the first time, that Flora Midgeholme was a goodnatured and a plucky woman, who bore uncomplainingly the hardships of a straitened income, eked it out by dispensing with the services of a maid and by breeding dogs, and always presented to the world the part of a woman well-satisfied with her lot. Only he did wish that she wouldn't call her dogs such absurd names.</p> <p>But this was unavoidable. On his retirement from the army, Major Midgeholme had built a bungalow in Thornden, at the end of the village street, where the tarred road ended and a mere cart-track led across the fields to a small farm. Mrs Midgeholme had conceived the pretty idea of calling the bungalow Ultima Thule; and when, in course of time, she began to breed Pekes Ultima had seemed to her the only possible patronymic to bestow upon them. Ultima Ulysses and Ultima Una, the progenitors of a long and lucrative line, received their alliterative names in a moment of impulsive inspiration. Ursula, Urban, and Urania had followed, and by that time the custom of alliteration had been established, and the supply of proper names was running out. Umberto, Uriah, and Ukica exhausted it, and succeeding generations of puppies received their names from the pages of a dictionary. 'But, after all,' said Mrs Midgeholme, looking on the bright side, 'they <i>are </i>rather quaint, aren't they? And Unready won two firsts and two seconds at Cruft's.'</p> <p>In the intervals of summoning Umberto, Umbrella, and Uppish out of other people's gardens, Mrs Midgeholme confided to her companion that although she had been invited to The Cedars to watch the tennis, and to take tea, she had been obliged to refuse. 'For I don't mind telling you, Mr Drybeck, that I doubt if I could trust myself.'</p> <p>'Dear me!' said Mr Drybeck, startled.</p> <p>'Not,' said Mrs Midgeholme, her eye kindling, 'if I am expected to speak to Mr Warrenby. And if he's there, which of course he will be, nothing would stop me giving him a piece of my mind! So I'm not going.'</p></p><h2>They Shoot Horses, Don&#39;t They?

While Fitzgerald and Hemingway were cultivating what Edmund Wilson once called their "own little corners," John Dos Passos was taking on the world. Counted as one of the best novels of the twentieth century by the Modern Library and by some of the finest writers working today, U.S.A. is a grand, kaleidoscopic portrait of a nation, buzzing with history and life on every page. <br><br>The trilogy opens with THE 42nd PARALLEL, where we find a young country at the dawn of the twentieth century. Slowly, in stories artfully spliced together, the lives and fortunes of five characters unfold.

As their lives cross and double back again, the likes of Eugene Debs, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Carnegie make cameo appearances.</p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettesJohn Dos Passos (1896-1970), a member of the Lost Generation, was the author of more than forty works of fiction and nonfiction, including THREE SOLDIERS and MANHATTAN TRANSFER.</p><h2>How Children Fail (Classics in Child Development)</h2><p>First published in the mid 1960s, <i>How Children Fail </i>began an education reform movement that continues today.

In <em>The God Who Risks</em> defends his answer with a careful and challenging argument.He first builds his case on an in-depth reading of the Old and New Testaments. Then Sanders probes philosophical, historical and systematic theology for further support. And he completes his defense with considerations drawn from practical theology.<em>The God Who Risks</em> is a profound and often inspiring presentation of "relational theism"--an understanding of providence in which "a personal God enters into genuine give-and-take relations with his creatures." With this book Sanders not only contributes to serious theological discussion but also enlightens pastors and laypersons who struggle with questions about suffering, evil and human free will.</p><p>John Sanders (Th.D., University of South Africa) is professor of religion at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas. He has edited and written several books, including <em>No Other Name: An Investigation into the Destiny of the Unevangelized.</em> Three of his previous book projects have received a <em>Christianity Today</em> Book Award."[<em>The God Who Risks</em> is] a major contribution to the dialogue between biblical and philosophical theology. John Sanders argues persuasively for belief in the God who risks and shows in detail that this view--in contrast to belief in the no-risk God--is consonant with the biblical tradition, conceptually coherent and able to account for the Christian life as a life of personal fellowship with God."

"His stories, which deluge us with feeling, make feeling more intelligent; more magnanimous. He is an artist of our moral maturity."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This volume presents forty-two of Chekhov's later short stories, written between 1888 and 1903, in acclaimed translations by Constance Garnett and chosen by Shelby Foote. Among the most outstanding are "A Dreary Story," a dispassionate tale that reflects Chekhov's doubts about his role as an artist. Thomas Mann deemed it "a truly extraordinary, fascinating story . . . unlike anything else in world literature." "The Darling," a delightful work highly admired by Tolstoy, offers comic proof that life has no meaning without love. And in "The Lady with the Dog," which Vladimir Nabokov called "one of the greatest stories ever written," a chance affair takes possession of a bored young woman and a cynical rouï¿½, changing their lives forever. Also included in this collection are the famous trilogy, "The Man in a Case," "Gooseberries," and "About Love," as <br>well as "Sleepy," "The Horse-Stealers," and "Betrothed."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The greatest of Chekhov's stories are, no matter how many times reread, always an experience that strikes deep into the soul and produces an alteration there," wrote William Maxwell. "As for those masterpieces 'The Lady with the Dog,' 'The Horse-Stealers,' 'Sleepy,' 'Gooseberries,' 'About Love'--where else do you see so clearly the difference between light and dark, or how dark darkness can be."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelby Foote has provided an Introduction for this edition.</p><p>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through his work, tough-minded and compas-<br>sionate, he bequeathed us an idiom with which to address the century he hardly lived to see."<br>--Robert Stone<p>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reading Chekhov, we first grow ecstatic, and then we grieve. For he is one of those writers whose spiritual and literary intelli-<br>gence (they are one thing with him) is so powerful that for a moment we are seduced by our pleasure into believing in human progress, in the moral evolution of the species; then, a moment later, we see that he is in fact only a giant, an anomaly, possibly an angel, and that we may not have another like him for a thousand years."<br>--Russell Banks</p><p><br>Y</p><p>Other Chekhov collections from the<br>Modern Library:<br>Early Short Stories: 1883-1888<br>Longer Stories from the Last Decade</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Henry VI Part III (The Pelican Shakespeare)</h2><p><b>The acclaimed Pelican Shakespeare series edited by A.

Time is a central concern for Proust, appearing first in the title and last as the final word of the novel. What is his vision of the past? Does he have a vision of the present? The future? Can the Narrator be said to be living in the past? Is he like the White Queen in Through the Looking-Glass , with &#39;jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today&#39;? 2. The renowned translator of Proust, C. K. Scott Moncrieff, originally grouped the opening section of In Search of Lost Time under the title &#39;The Overture,&#39; which includes two famous passages, the good night kiss and the evocative taste of the madeleine. Does this seem apt? If so, how might this fifty-odd page beginning prefigure what will transpire later? What would you expect to follow, given that an overture usually introduces the main themes of a musical work? What does it suggest about Proust&#39;s conception of literature and music? 3. The episode of the good night kiss strikes some readers as odd or contradictory: the Narrator&#39;s need for a kiss seems almost infantile, while his power of observation seems extraordinarily precocious. Considering that he is sent to bed at eight o&#39;clock, how old do you think the Narrator is? Is it significant that his father suggests the Narrator be given the kiss he craves, whereas his mother is reluctant, saying &#39;We mustn&#39;t let the child get into the habit . . .&#39;? Is the fact that the Narrator succeeds in getting the kiss he wants a good thing or a bad thing? Why? 4. &#39;The whole of Proust&#39;s world comes out of a teacup,&#39; observed Samuel Beckett. Indeed the episode of the madeleine dipped in tea is the first (and most famous) of numerous instances of &#39;involuntary memory&#39; in the novel. A recognized psychological phenomenon triggered by smells, tastes, or sounds, involuntary memory vividly reproduces emotions, sensations, or images from the past. Why do you think readers and critics universally consider this scene to be pivotal? What does the Narrator think about the experience of involuntary memory? What might its function be in the scheme of In Search of Lost Time ? 5. Another emblematic theme involves the recurring &#39;little phrase&#39; of music by Vinteuil that catches the ear of Swann at the Verdurin&#39;s salon and steals into his life. How do Vinteuil&#39;s compositions stir both Swann and the Narrator? In Proust&#39;s scheme of things, is music a higher art than painting or writing because it can produce involuntary memories? How does involuntary memory affect writing and painting? Is it unrelated to art except as a necessary catalyst? 6. In &#39;Combray&#39; we are introduced to the Narrator&#39;s family, their household, and their country home. Since Paris is the true heart of upper-class France, why do you think Proust chose to begin In Search of Lost Time elsewhere? What do we learn from the Narrator&#39;s description of his family&#39;s life and habits? Is the household dominated by men or by women? Does the Narrator&#39;s account seem accurate, or is it colored by his own ideas and preoccupations? 7. A madeleine dipped into a cup of tea first impelled Proust into the &#39;remembrance of things past.&#39; Though Proust was a gourmet in his youth, in the final years of his life he subsisted mainly on fillets of sole, chicken, fried potatoes, ice cream, cakes, fruit, and iced beer. Consider how food and culinary happenings - from meals at the restaurant in the Grand Hotel in Balbec to dinners at La Raspeliï¿½re and the Guermantes&#39;s in Paris - form an integral part of the work. 8. Swann&#39;s Way and the Guermantes Way are presented as mutually exclusive choices for promenades, with Swann&#39;s Way given primacy of place at the novel&#39;s outset. Where, metaphorically speaking, does Swann&#39;s Way seem to lead? What are the aesthetic signposts and milestones the Narrator points out? What does the landscape around Combray represent? 9. &#39;I want my work to be a sort of cathedral in literature,&#39; Proust once said. In his description of the area around Combray - and in many other places in the novel - the Narrator describes churches, and particularly steeples. Indeed, Howard Moss cites the steeple as one of Proust&#39;s most important symbols. In religious architecture, the steeple represents man&#39;s aspiration toward God, and by inference toward Art, the Proustian religion. What else might it suggest? Does it have a counterpart in nature? 10. Proust and the Narrator share an appreciation of gardens and flowers - Proust himself was eager to visit Monet&#39;s celebrated garden - and in a sense, all Combray can be seen as a garden. What associations does this evoke? How does the Narrator respond to natural beauty? What do flowers mean to him? How do we know? 11. Proust&#39;s work is filled with &#39;doubling&#39; - the most obvious being the identification of the author with a fictional self of the same name but with somewhat different characteristics. Is Swann a double of the Narrator? What qualities do they share? In what ways do they seem different? What is the importance of the fact that Swann is a Jew? 12. Louis Auchincloss questions the use of a fictional first person named &#39;Marcel,&#39; who is but isn&#39;t Proust. Marcel claims that he is neither a snob nor a homosexual, yet he is obsessed with both. Would Proust have strengthened Marcel&#39;s viewpoint by making it that of the young social climber that he himself so clearly was? Did he enhance or detract from Marcel&#39;s credibility by casting him as one of the few heterosexuals in the book? Does it matter that Marcel regards &#39;inversion&#39; as a dangerous vice? Did Proust? 13. &#39;Swann in Love&#39; might be thought of as a dress rehearsal for the Narrator&#39;s own performance, and Swann&#39;s passion for Odette establishes a model for various other love relationships that appear later in the book. Proust believed that all emotions and behavior obey certain psychological laws. E. M. Forster maintained that &#39;Proust&#39;s general theory of human intercourse is that the fonder we are of people the less we understand them - the theory of the complete pessimist.&#39; Do you agree? How does Swann&#39;s love affair reflect this? What conclusions does the Narrator draw from his perception of Swann&#39;s experience? In what way does this differ from Swann&#39;s own view? 14. The Balbec sequence of Within a Budding Grove gathers a group of the novel&#39;s principal characters, many for the first time: Robert de Saint-Loup, the Baron de Charlus, and Albertine, to name three of the most important. Others begin to emerge in their true significance, like Elstir the painter. Why do you think Proust chose to bring them together in Balbec? In what ways does Balbec echo or amplify Combray? Is the little &#39;society&#39; of Balbec a preview in microcosm of Paris? 15. While writing In Search of Lost Time Proust often rummaged through his vast photographic collection of Belle ï¿½poque luminaries as a means of stimulating his memory. &#39;You could see that his thoughts were following a kind of underground track, as if he were organizing everything into images before putting them into words,&#39; recalled his maid Cï¿½leste Albaret. Indeed, the Baron de Charlus, in Within a Budding Grove , speaks of the special importance of photographs in preserving an unsullied moment of time past, before it has been altered by the present. Discuss how Proust used photographs in the story - just as he exploited the technology of trains, cars, and airplanes - as symbols of passing time. 16. In his landmark essay on Proust, Edmund Wilson praises the broad Dickensian humor and extravagant satire that animate vast sections of In Search of Lost Time , yet he goes on to call it &#39;one of the gloomiest books ever written.&#39; Can you reconcile Wilson&#39;s remarks? 17. Critic Barbara Bucknall maintains that &#39;no Proustian lover really cares at all for his beloved&#39;s feelings.&#39; Is this true? Would the Narrator agree? Would the</p><p>The "Guermantes Way," in this the third volume of "In Search of Lost Time, refers to the path that leads to the Duc and Duchess de Guermantes's chateau near Combray. It also represents the narrator's passage into the rarefied "social kaleidoscope" of the Guermantes's Paris salon, an important intellectual playground for Parisian society, where he becomes a party to the wit and manners of the Guermantes's drawing room. Here he encounters nobles, officers, socialites, and assorted consorts, including Robert de Saint Loup and his prostitute mistress Rachel, the Baron de Charlus, and the Prince de Borodino. <br>For this authoritative English-language edition, D.

Braudel calls on the historian to penetrate beneath the surface of political events to uncover and measure the forces shaping collective existence. Cycles of production, wages and prices, grids of communication and trade, fluctuations and climate, demographic trends, popular beliefs&#x2014;all of these phenomena are proper subjects of the historian's investigations. It is only through study of the <i>longue durï¿½e</i>, Braudel argues, that one can discern structure, the supports and obstacles, the limits and his experience cannot escape.<br><br>"The great French historian Fernand Braudel has done what only giants can: he has made Western man confront the problem of time&#x2014;individual time, historical time, relative time, <i>real</i> time. . . . Braudel, more than any other historian, has wrestled with man's conception of time <i>over time</i>. . . What a magnificent fight he has fought."&#x2014;<i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i></p><p><p> Fernand Braudel is a member of The French Academy.</p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering</h2><p>This iconoclastic study was one of the most widely debated books of 2000. Finkelstein indicts with both vigor and honesty those who exploit the tragedy of the Holocaust for their own personal political and financial gain. This new edition includes updated material discussing the initial reception to the book&#x2019;s publication. In an iconoclastic and controversial new study, Norman G. Finkelstein moves from an interrogation of the place the Holocaust has come to occupy in American culture to a disturbing examination of recent Holocaust compensation agreements. It was not until the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, when Israel&#x2019;s evident strength brought it into line with US foreign policy, that memory of the Holocaust began to acquire the exceptional prominence it enjoys today. Leaders of America&#x2019;s Jewish community were delighted that Israel was now deemed a major strategic asset and, Finkelstein contends, exploited the Holocaust to enhance this newfound status. Their subsequent interpretations of the tragedy are often at variance with actual historical events and are employed to deflect any criticism of Israel and its supporters. Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosinski and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of Nazism&#x2019;s victims comes not from the distortions of Holocaust deniers but from prominent, self-proclaimed guardians of Holocaust memory. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries as well as legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket. Thoroughly researched and closely argued, <i>The Holocaust Industry</i> is all the more disturbing and powerful because the issues it deals with are so rarely discussed.</p><p><b>Norman G.

From Old <br>and New Testament scenes to the myth of Perseus and the <br>Gorgon and the blinding of Polyphemus, Derrida uncovers in <br>these images rich, provocative layers of interpretation. <br><br>For Derrida drawing is itself blind; as an act rooted in <br>memory and anticipation, drawing necessarily replaces one <br>kind of seeing (direct) with another (mediated). Ultimately, <br>he explains, the very lines which compose any drawing are <br>themselves never fully visible to the viewer since they exist <br>only in a tenuous state of multiple identities: as marks on <br>a page, as indicators of a contour. Lacking a "pure" <br>identity, the lines of a drawing summon the supplement of the <br>word, of verbal discourse, and, in doing so, obscure the <br>visual experience. Consequently, Derrida demonstrates, the <br>very act of depicting a blind person undertakes multiple <br>enactments and statements of blindness and sight. <br><br><i>Memoirs of the Blind</i> is both a sophisticated <br>philosophical argument and a series of detailed readings. <br>Derrida provides compelling insights into famous and lesser <br>known works, interweaving analyses of texts&#x2014;including <br>Diderot's <i>Lettres sur les aveugles</i>, the notion of <br>mnemonic art in Baudelaire's <i>The Painter of Modern </i><br><i>Life</i>, and Merleau-Ponty's <i>The Visible and the </i><br><i>Invisible</i>. Along with engaging meditations on the history <br>and philosophy of art, Derrida reveals the ways viewers <br>approach philosophical ideas through art, and the ways art <br>enriches philosophical reflection. <br><br>An exploration of sight, representation, and art, <br><i>Memoirs of the Blind</i> extends and deepens the <br>meditation on vision and painting presented in <i>Truth and </i><br><i>Painting</i>. Readers of Derrida, both new and familiar, will <br>profit from this powerful contribution to the study of the <br>visual arts.</p><p><b>Jacques Derrida</b> (1930&#x2013;2004) was director of studies at the ï¿½cole des hautes ï¿½tudes en sciences sociales, Paris, and professor of humanities at the University of California, Irvine.

In it, Wade challenged claims both of those who saw the East Asian story as a vindication of free market principles and of those who attributed the success of Taiwan and other countries to government intervention. Instead, Wade turned attention to the way allocation decisions were divided between markets and public administration and the synergy between them. Now, in a new introduction to this paperback edition, Wade reviews the debate about industrial policy in East and Southeast Asia and chronicles the changing fortunes of these economies over the 1990s. He extends the original argument to explain the boom of the first half of the decade and the crash of the second, stressing the links between corporations, banks, governments, international capital markets, and the International Monetary Fund. From this, Wade goes on to outline a new agenda for national and international development policy.</p></p><p><b>Robert Wade</b> is Professor of Political Economy at the London School of Economics.

Congress)."[This] study by Robert Wade is one of only a handful that describes how economic policy in East Asia has actually worked. . . . A superb book. . . . Governing the Market demystifies East Asia's miracle without making it seem any less remarkable. It assaults idle prejudice on every side of the debate about markets and the role of government. It is long overdue, and deserves to be widely read." (<i>Economist</i>)<br><br>"This valuable book provides a quite detailed and carefully analytical account of the economic development of Taiwan and its political and social setting. . . .

Do specific characteristics exist that affect or predict an individual's ability to serve in the role of coach? How does a coach's personality influence his or her effectiveness? These are a few questions that might come to mind for a practitioner who is considering implementing a coaching style of interaction. </p><p>In her chapter "Talking to Families," P.J. McWilliam (2010) noted that there are many challenges to developing effective family-professional partnerships and that interpersonal factors play a substantial role in the quality of such relationships. In their seminal work, Dunst and Trivette (2009) researched characteristics of effective helpgiving that relate to the field of early childhood. These key principles must be employed in order to provide "help" that is indeed helpful and meaningful rather than being detrimental and creating dependency. In their text <i>Using Skilled Dialogue to Transform Challenging Interactions</i>, Barrera and Kramer (2009) provide valuable information on how two people who are very different from each other can effectively engage in a nonhierarchical and nonjudgmental partnership. This chapter is intended to compile the information from such sources in order to help both experienced and novice coaches develop a deeper understanding of what characterizes an effective coach and to promote self-reflection among coaches to ensure that they take a research-based approach to helpgiving. </p><p><b>FAMILY-CENTERED PRACTITIONERS</b></p><p>Understanding and implementing family-centered practices is a key principle in early childhood intervention (Brewer, McPherson, Magrab, &amp; Hutchins, 1989; Hanson, Johnson, Jeppson, Thomas, &amp; Hall, 1994; Johnson, 1990; McBride, Brotherson, Joanning, Whiddon, &amp; Demmitt, 1993; Shelton, Jeppson, &amp; Johnson, 1987; Shelton &amp; Stepanek, 1994, 1995; Turnbull, Turbiville, &amp; Turnbull, 2000; Workgroup on Principles and Practices in Natural Environments, 2007). Although key elements of family-centered care have been delineated, infusing the approach into the day-to-day implementation in early childhood systems, programs, and individual teacher and therapist practices is easier said than done. </p><p>At the core of the provision of family-centered care lies the premise that practitioners believe that all families are capable and competent. In addition, when a coach is using a family-centered approach, he or she enters into the process of developing a relationship with the family. The coach pays particular attention to "leveling the playing field" and supporting parents and other care providers, recognizing what they have to offer and contribute in the partnership. McWilliam (2010) provided a checklist for implementing principles of family-centered care by effectively communicating with families in ways that 1) create opportunities for informal dialogue, 2) acknowledge family strengths and competencies, 3) solicit parents' opinions and ideas, 4) seek understanding, 5) demonstrate caring for the entire family, and 6) acknowledge and respond to the feelings and emotions of the family. </p><p>When a coach is implementing family-centered care, his or her ability to effectively communicate with family members is an essential skill. Characteristics of an effective communicator include but are not limited to demonstrating attributes of being caring, empathetic, and engaging. Use of active listening and being mindful of and responsive to nonverbal communication also are behaviors and strategies that, when implemented, lead to expanded opportunities for nonhierarchical coach&#x2013;coachee interactions (Burley-Allen, 1995). In the literature about family-centered practices, interpersonal qualities of practitioners are considered to be vital factors for promoting positive outcomes for families (Blue-Banning, Summers, Frankland, Nelson, &amp; Beegle, 2004; Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009; McWilliam, Tocci, &amp; Harbin, 1998; Park &amp; Turnbull, 2003). Trust, honesty, respect, and behaviors that promote equitable relationships are repeatedly mentioned as characteristics of effective practitioners who are implementing family-centered care. </p><p><b>RELATIONAL AND PARTICIPATORY HELPGIVERS</b></p><p>As we mentioned in Chapter 2, over the past several decades, the work of Dunst and Trivette (see Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009, for summary and review) informs the field of early childhood intervention in many ways, but particularly important are their in-depth contributions related to effective helpgiving practices. Helpgiving that promotes positive outcomes for all family members and is family centered has two components: 1) relational helpgiving practices and 2) participatory helpgiving practices. </p><p>Relational helpgiving practices focus on the relationship between the helpgiver and the help receiver, particularly the help receiver's appraisal of the presumed beliefs of the helpgiver toward the help receiver. More specifically, relational helpgiving includes both helpgiver interpersonal skills with help receivers and the attitudes of the helpgiver about the help receiver's capability to become more competent. For example, consider a situation in which an early intervention coach is supporting a young, first-time mother and her newborn infant who was prenatally exposed to cocaine. If through his actions, comments, or behavior the coach appears to the mother to be negative or judgmental, their partnership will be compromised and the outcomes for that parent and child will probably not be optimized. Relational helpgiving practices include behaviors such as compassion, empathy, active listening, openness, honesty, and trustworthiness. The help receiver must feel supported and must know and believe that the helpgiver cares about him or her on a personal level, as well as caring about the outcomes for the help receiver and his or her family (Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009). </p><p>The second component of effective helpgiving practices is participatory helpgiving. Participatory helpgiving includes both choice and action on the part of the help receiver and responsiveness and flexibility on the part of the helpgiver. It emphasizes support of the action and participation of the help receiver and focuses on strengthening existing help receiver capabilities and promoting new help receiver competencies. Participatory helpgiving practices meaningfully involve help receivers in the choices and decisions that they make and the actions that they take to achieve their desired goals and outcomes. The focus of participatory helpgiving is to implement strategies that support the help receiver to attribute accomplishments, new skills and capabilities, and achievement of desired outcomes to his or her actions and decisions. Research indicates that in order for positive outcomes to be achieved, both relational and participatory helpgiving practices must be present (Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009). </p><p>Consider a practitioner who observes that one of the children she supports through home visiting does not have any nice toys. The coach is concerned about this situation. She knows that her program has an abundance of nice toys that are no longer used because they have stopped taking toy bags with them to home visits and instead use what children and families have readily available in their environments. The coach decides to give a few of the former toy bag toys to the family. On her next visit, the coach is surprised by the parent's reaction to her gift. The mother expresses thanks, but the coach notices that she becomes quiet and more withdrawn. Although the coach had good intentions, she violated a primary premise of effective helpgiving practices. Yes, the coach demonstrated relational helpgiving; a caring and generous attitude toward the child and family. She did not, however, implement participatory helpgiving practices in this situation. In addition, a significant finding in this area of research is that provision of supports in the absence of an identified family priority or need results in negative outcomes regarding the capacity of family members (Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009). </p><p>Consider an alternative response on the part of the coach that demonstrates both relational and participatory helpgiving practices. As the coach was getting to know the family, she began identifying the interests of the child. The mother mentioned that her young son loved a particular toy that they had seen at the grocery store, but indicated that she could not afford to buy it and that she felt bad about the situation. The coach then asked the mother how she might support her in feeling better about the situation. The mother responded eagerly that she was very interested in identifying some options for toys for her child. A discussion ensued between the coach and coachee about what the mother thought the child liked about particular toys at the store. They also explored past strategies that the mother had used to identify and obtain needed resources, such as shopping at yard sales, the thrift store, and the flea market. As the conversation continued, the mother considered additional options&#x2014;for example, trading toys with a neighbor or family member and visiting the local library. Then she developed a plan for when and how she would accomplish her goal of obtaining toys for her child. </p><p>In the second version of the scenario, the coach demonstrated both relational and participatory helpgiving practices. She showed that she was listening to the parent and displayed care and concern for the mother's feelings and priorities. In addition, the coach engaged in participatory helpgiving practices by implementing a resource-based conversation that engaged the mother in identifying previous strategies, analyzing past successes, and developing a plan of action to achieve her desired outcome. </p><p>In light of the evidence about relational and participatory helpgiving practices, particularly with regard to empowerment of family members, practitioners must be aware of and develop skills which ensure that families know and believe the practitioners care about them. In addition, a practitioner must implement strategies and demonstrate behaviors that promote choice and action on the part of the coachee. The coach must support the coachee to readily attribute achievement of desired outcomes to his or her actions. Parents' attribution of the importance and success of their participation, decisions, and actions is a critical factor in building their own capacity to care for their children. </p><p><b>CHOOSING RELATIONSHIP OVER CONTROL</b></p><p>As we will discuss later in this book (in Chapters 7 and 10 specifically), working closely with people from diverse backgrounds can be a new and challenging experience for many early childhood practitioners. Diversity can be expressed in many ways, such as through cultural beliefs and traditions, types and variety of life experiences, and socioeconomic challenges. When they are working with family members and other care providers, practitioners who are using coaching are immediately faced with many of these issues, as the need to communicate effectively is critical for every early childhood coach. Being open to coaching relationships with people who are different from oneself is an essential element of becoming an effective coach. </p><p>The literature that we reviewed about characteristics of coaches that depict use of family-centered care and effective helpgiving describes the behaviors and traits that a coach should possess. The attitudes and beliefs of a coach are also important. Hanson and Lynch (2010) and Lynch and Hanson (2004) provided insights that early childhood coaches can consider when developing a new partnership. A coach might think about how his or her own beliefs, past experiences, and traditions are different from the coachee. Barrera and Kramer (2009) have written extensively about how to approach and improve interactions with others, particularly when they have different backgrounds and life experiences. Barrera and Kramer refer to their approach as Skilled Dialogue, and their writings contain helpful information and specific strategies for coaches in a variety of challenging situations, particularly when the coach is inexperienced or has difficulty finding success. </p><p>Understanding and embracing diversity is a complex challenge for most early childhood coaches. The concept of "choosing relationship over control" (Barrera &amp; Kramer, 2009, p. 51) seems particularly useful from a coaching perspective. Specifically, a coach who chooses to value the relationship with the coachee, rather than controlling the interaction, places an "implicit and explicit focus" on developing mutual understanding, respect, and acknowledgment of the other person's perspective in connection with one's own (Barrera &amp; Kramer, 2009, p. 52): Skilled Dialogue calls for a disposition toward choosing relationship over control . . . 1) as a counterbalance to the tendency to choose control; 2) as a direct expression of another's dignity and worth as equal to one's own; and 3) as a more effective means of establishing truly collaborative partnerships. </p><p>The coaching relationship is not about agreeing 100% of the time with the coachee or condoning his or her particular behaviors or actions. Developing a true partnership, however, does require constant reflection on the part of the coach and active consideration of the other person's ideas and viewpoint. The coach may find himself or herself in situations in which it is difficult to remain open to understanding how the coachee views the world, his or her possible options and choices, and his or her responses to the decisions that have been made. When a coach feels uncomfortable or judgmental, seeking to understand the coachee's view will certainly afford extended opportunities for the coaching relationship to grow, unlike what might happen in situations in which a coachee feels that his or her coach does not approve of the choices or decisions he or she has made. </p><p>Context is a key feature involved in choosing relationship over control (Barrera &amp; Kramer, 2009). Specifically, the coach should strive to create an interpersonal context in which the knowledge and experiences of the coach are tied to a real person (the coachee) who has real thoughts and feelings and about whom the coach actually cares. When a coach steps outside the context and considers a choice or decision made by the coachee based on what he or she (the coach) would have done or what he or she feels the coachee "should" have done, then the relationship is at risk due to the imbalance created by the hierarchical nature of the coach's thoughts. Instead, when a coach is faced with a lack of understanding he or she should seek to view the situation from the coachee's perspective and gather more information that will support the coach in maintaining an open, honest, and caring perspective. </p><p>For example, consider a situation in which a coach has supported a parent in her priority to maintain a budg...</p></p><h2>Swirl by Swirl Board Book: Spirals in Nature</h2><p><b>Handpicked by Amazon kids&#x2019; books editor, Seira Wilson, for Prime Book Box &#x2013; a children&#x2019;s subscription that inspires a love of reading.</b><br><br><b>Sidman's lyrical poetry and Krommes' charming illustrations&nbsp;illuminate this&nbsp;intriguing shape found all throughout the universe.&nbsp;Young readers&nbsp;will enjoy&nbsp;discovering all of&nbsp;the different spirals in nature in this new board book edition.&nbsp;</b><p>What makes the tiny snail shell so beautiful?

The medicine of the artist, like that of the shaman, arises from his or her relationship to "familiars"&#x2014;the themes, methods, and materials that interact with the artist through the creative process. <i>Art As Medicine </i> demonstrates how the imagination heals and renews itself through this natural process. The author describes his pioneering methods of art therapy&#x2014;including interpretation through performance and storytelling, creative collaboration, and dialoguing with images&#x2014;and the ways in which they can revitalize both psychotherapy and art itself.</p><p>Shaun McNiff is internationally recognized as a founder and leading figure in the arts and healing field.

Declaration of Human Rights. But if these ideals no longer seem radical today, their origin was very radical indeed--far more so than most historians have been willing to recognize. In <i>A Revolution of the Mind</i>, Jonathan Israel, one of the world's leading historians of the Enlightenment, traces the philosophical roots of these ideas to what were the least respectable strata of Enlightenment thought--what he calls the Radical Enlightenment.</p><br><p> Originating as a clandestine movement of ideas that was almost entirely hidden from public view during its earliest phase, the Radical Enlightenment matured in opposition to the moderate mainstream Enlightenment dominant in Europe and America in the eighteenth century. During the revolutionary decades of the 1770s, 1780s, and 1790s, the Radical Enlightenment burst into the open, only to provoke a long and bitter backlash. <i>A Revolution of the Mind</i> shows that this vigorous opposition was mainly due to the powerful impulses in society to defend the principles of monarchy, aristocracy, empire, and racial hierarchy--principles linked to the upholding of censorship, church authority, social inequality, racial segregation, religious discrimination, and far-reaching privilege for ruling groups.</p><br><p> In telling this fascinating history, <i>A Revolution of the Mind</i> reveals the surprising origin of our most cherished values--and helps explain why in certain circles they are frequently disapproved of and attacked even today.</p></p><p><p>"This book succeeds beautifully. Written with confidence and concision, it lays out Jonathan Israel's central ideas about the Radical Enlightenment and its fundamental importance in shaping the values of democratic modernity. Those who already know his work will find a clear and bold statement of his principal arguments, as well as important elaborations and expansions.

But in <i>Philosophy and Real Politics</i>, Raymond Geuss argues that philosophers should first try to understand why real political actors behave as they actually do. Far from being applied ethics, politics is a skill that allows people to survive and pursue their goals. To understand politics is to understand the powers, motives, and concepts that people have and that shape how they deal with the problems they face in their particular historical situations.</p><br><br><p> <i>Philosophy and Real Politics</i> both outlines a historically oriented, realistic political philosophy and criticizes liberal political philosophies based on abstract conceptions of rights and justice. The book is a trenchant critique of established ways of thought and a provocative call for change.</p></p><p><p>"In this new study, Raymond Geuss mobilizes the strength of analytical philosophy to subvert the theoretical premises of contemporary political philosophy. He replaces its fixation on ideal norms and its abstraction from real confrontations with an orientation toward contexts of action and a rigorous concentration on the importance of political power. It is fascinating to see the result: a political philosophy that is once again a kind of intellectual craft, historically situated and locally engaged."<b>--Axel Honneth, J. W. Goethe University, Frankfurt</b></p><p>Raymond Geuss is the most sophisticated and subtle philosopher who takes seriously the tradition of critical theory. His critique of formal political philosophy--including in neo-Kantian philosophy like that of the late John Rawls--that shuns the crucial roles of power, historical context, and political action is powerful and persuasive. This grand text is an intellectual breath of fresh air."<b>--Cornel West, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Raymond Geuss's short, brilliant, and provocative book forces on political philosophers questions that we often prefer not to raise, let alone answer. Geuss takes seriously the disturbingly untidy character of many political transactions and the dangers of idealized abstractions. His ruthlessness toward Nozick and Rawls is in striking contrast to the attitudes of most of their critics. And Geuss lives dangerously, prescribing remedies drawn from Lenin, Nietzsche, and Weber that may have unpredictable side effects."<b>--Alasdair MacIntyre, University of Notre Dame</b></p><p>"This is a small gem of a book.

Her first novel, <i>When Rain Clouds Gather</i> grew out of her experience as a refugee, and was followed by <i>Maru</i> and <i>A Question of Power</i> (1973). In 1977 she published <i>The Collector of Treasure</i>s, a book of short stories exploring the position of women in Africa. </p> <br>Bessie Head died in Serowe, Botswana in 1986, aged only 49.<i>Collector of Treasures</i> explores the lives of Botswana villagers, both before their colonization by the British and after their independence in 1966. Bessie Head tells tales of ancient leaders, of educated women trying to find their way between city and village life, of women who must suffer while men treat the independence of their country as an opportunity to throw away all restrictions, British or tribal. In these stories, it is the women who suffer most - who bear the children after the men have deserted them, who endure the village gossip, who raise the money for their children's school fees as their husbands support other women. But though they suffer, these are women of strength and inner beauty. Johannah, tall and striking, reminds the villagers "the children of a real woman do not get lean or die." Dikeledi, in jail for killing her husband, still "had always found gold amidst the ash, deep loves that had joined her heart to the hearts of others." While men are often the villains of these stories, <i>Collector of Treasures</i> also creates a new hero, the kind of man she calls "a poem of tenderness." Bessie Head's love for her characters is rich and glowing, as strong as her anger at those, British or African, who destroy the traditions of empathy, hard-work, and sharing that lie at the heart of this goodness. Her words flow through their "uncertain story of independence" like a great, golden river. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Mechanical Vibration</h2><p>Model, analyze, and solve vibration problems, using modern computer tools.<br> <br> Featuring clear explanations, worked examples, applications, and modern computer tools, William Palm's Mechanical Vibration provides a firm foundation in vibratory systems.

We think of him as a larger-than-life original, yet in <i>The Naturalist</i>, Darrin Lunde has firmly situated Roosevelt&#x2019;s indomitable curiosity about the natural world in the tradition of museum naturalism.&nbsp; <br><br>As a child, Roosevelt actively modeled himself on the men (including John James Audubon and Spencer F. Baird) who pioneered this key branch of biology by developing a taxonomy of the natural world&#x2014;basing their work on the experiential study of nature. The impact that these scientists and their trailblazing methods had on Roosevelt shaped not only his audacious personality but his entire career, informing his work as a statesman and ultimately affecting generations of Americans&#x2019; relationship to this country&#x2019;s wilderness. <br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on Roosevelt&#x2019;s diaries and travel journals as well as Lunde&#x2019;s own role as a leading figure in museum naturalism today, <i>The Naturalist</i> reads Roosevelt through the lens of his love for nature. From his teenage collections of birds and small mammals to his time at Harvard and political rise, Roosevelt&#x2019;s fascination with wildlife and exploration culminated in his triumphant expedition to Africa, a trip which he himself considered to be the apex of his varied life. <br><br>With narrative verve, Lunde brings his singular experience to bear on our twenty-sixth president&#x2019;s life and constructs a perceptively researched and insightful history that tracks Roosevelt&#x2019;s maturation from exuberant boyhood hunter to vital champion of serious scientific inquiry.</p></p><p><p><b>DARRIN LUNDE </b>is a Supervisory Museum Specialist in the Division of Mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.

Still sporting a full head of baby curls, the child seemed barely old enough to be out in the city alone, and he looked frail, as if he might have been sick.<br><br>Horse-drawn carriages rattled by, dropping off elegant women in hoop-skirted dresses and big hats. Gathering their billowing raiments up with their fingers, they floated in and out of stores showcasing velvet gloves, mink stoles, and fancy sweets. This was &#x201c;Ladies&#x2019; Mile&#x201d;&#x2014;that stretch of Broadway between Union and Madison Squares where New York&#x2019;s fancy boutiques competed for space and well-heeled customers.<br><br>Jostled by the swarms of fashionable shoppers, the boy continued along Broadway, glancing through the storefront windows, until he passed a familiar grocery, where something caught his eye. Amid the usual cartons of fruits and vegetables was an object strangely out of place, splayed out on a slab of wood. It was the dull mass of a seal, dead less than a day. Placed on display to attract paying customers, its corpulent body drew the child&#x2019;s attention.<br><br>Sliding his hand along the seal&#x2019;s glossy-smooth pelt and peering deeply into its clouding eyes, he was overwhelmed with interest. Its eyes were so big, and they were fringed with delicate eyelashes&nbsp;like his own. Curious onlookers stood back, only a brave few leaning in for a closer look, but the little boy remained transfixed. It was probably a harbor seal, still fairly common in New York Harbor. So transfixed was the boy by this exotic creature that he raced home for a notebook and ruler, returning moments later to measure the carcass and jot down a few notes on its color and appearance. The eight-year-old boy then wrote a detailed natural history of seals based entirely on that one dead animal.<br><br>Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s life changed forever in that encounter, for it marked, as he later noted, &#x201c;the first day&#x201d; of his career as a naturalist. Recalling the event in his autobiography decades later, Roosevelt wrote that the seal filled him with &#x201c;every possible feeling of romance and adventure.&#x201d; It was so unlike anything he had ever seen before. Touching that seal, he would have felt the stiffness of its long, graceful whiskers, and, gently lifting up its lips, he would have seen the gleaming white teeth. The ears were just tiny holes, barely noticeable in its dense fur. Squeezing the front flippers, he would have felt that they were just like greatly enlarged hands, the individual finger bones completely encased in the flesh of the flipper with tiny claws extending from the tip. Feeling the seal&#x2019;s body with his own hands, he could appreciate all the similarities to his own basic anatomy, but he wanted to get closer&#x2014;to take the animal home, perhaps to dissect or stuff it. He had read about how naturalists kept animal specimens to study them, and now he had a chance to practice naturalism himself.<br><br>Born on October 27, 1858, to Theodore Roosevelt Sr. and Martha Bulloch Roosevelt (known as &#x201c;Mittie&#x201d;), Theodore was one in a long line of Roosevelts to have lived in Manhattan, the descendant of some of New York&#x2019;s early Dutch settlers. The family had always been well-off, but Theodore&#x2019;s paternal grandfather, Cornelius Roosevelt, amassed an incredible fortune through real estate speculation. From his redbrick mansion on the southwest corner of Broadway at 14th Street, Cornelius settled each of his five sons in nearby homes. Theodore Sr. was given a four-story brownstone just a short walk uptown,&nbsp;on East 20th Street. It was here that Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born and raised with his older sister, Anna (nicknamed &#x201c;Bamie&#x201d;), younger brother, Elliott (&#x201c;Ellie&#x201d;), and their baby sister, Corinne (&#x201c;Conie&#x201d;).<br><br>Tall, bearded, and with fierce blue eyes beneath heavy brows, Theodore Roosevelt Sr. looked grim, but to those who knew him well, Mr. Roosevelt was benevolence personified. Although he was a partner in the Wall Street investment banking firm Roosevelt &amp; Son, he preferred to think of himself as a philanthropist, and he took great pleasure in championing charitable causes. He especially adored children, even spending Sunday evenings serving meals to destitute newsboys and street urchins.<br><br>To his own family Roosevelt Sr. represented strength and courage, tenderness and great unselfishness. He was so admired by his children that they went to great lengths to compete for his attention. Theodore Jr. later recalled that his father was &#x201c;the best man I ever knew&#x201d; but added that he was also &#x201c;the only man of whom I was ever really afraid.&#x201d; What Theodore feared most was his father&#x2019;s stern disapproval&#x2014;for Theodore, nothing was more important than earning the respect of his father.<br><br>Perhaps more than anything, Mr. Roosevelt was shaped by his views as a &#x201c;muscular Christian.&#x201d; A popular movement with British and American Protestants of the Victorian era, muscular Christianity taught that Jesus was not only morally strong but also physically sturdy. Masculinity&#x2014;as shown in the will to fight for a cause&#x2014;was seen as integral to Christian morality. Muscular Christianity was the answer to a growing concern among men that the world was becoming overly feminized, a reaction to the increasing number of sedentary occupations in the industrializing world and women&#x2019;s growing role in the church. The movement stressed physical activity and spending time outdoors, urging cold-water swims and vigorous mountain climbs.<br><br>In sharp contrast to the muscular Christians and her robust, rugged husband, Martha Roosevelt was meek and genteel, a southerner who had grown up in a Georgia plantation house. While Mr. Roosevelt worked tirelessly, Mrs. Roosevelt was physically frail and often&nbsp;complained of fatigue. She was obsessively hygienic and had a penchant for immaculate white dresses, which she wore year-round. One acquaintance described her as &#x201c;the purest woman he ever saw. No matter how dirty, hot, and ruffled everyone else looked, Mrs. Roosevelt seemed so cool and clean. No dirt ever stopped near her.&#x201d; To her children, she was distant, like a delicate china doll&#x2014;beautiful to look at but fragile and cold.<br><br>Young Theodore Jr. inherited his mother&#x2019;s frailty. No amount of money could spare him the almost constant stomachaches, headaches, coughs, fevers, and nausea he suffered. But Theodore&#x2019;s most chronic and persistent struggle was with asthma. He was plagued by the horror of battling for a shallow gasp of air, only to have anxiety trigger still more severe struggles for breath. Theodore&#x2019;s asthma attacks lasted from a few hours to several days of nonstop wheezing, and it was never entirely certain that he would survive to adulthood.<br><br>At the time, asthma was a poorly understood condition, which doctors mistakenly attributed to a narrow chest. There were no effective treatments, so the sufferers and their families were often left to devise their own desperate cures. Roosevelt Sr.&#x2014;so distraught by his son&#x2019;s ill-health&#x2014;once summoned a horse and rig from a neighboring stable so that he could take young Theodore on a vigorous nighttime ride, attempting to force air into the small boy&#x2019;s lungs.<br><br>Fearful of letting the sickly boy out of their sight, his family rarely allowed him far from their watchful eyes, and (except for a very brief period) he never attended school. Although trapped inside all day, fearing his next asthma attack, Theodore sought solace in his father&#x2019;s library&#x2014;a dark, windowless room on the first floor of their town house. Lined with bookcases of &#x201c;gloomy respectability&#x201d; and cluttered with coarse horsehair chairs that scratched his bare legs, the library was, nonetheless, a sanctuary for the young boy. Sitting on his favorite velvet stool or standing with one leg propped against a wall and his neck bent sharply downward, he lost himself in books.<br><br>In these tomes, Theodore found adventure. One of his favorites was Scots medical missionary David Livingstone&#x2019;s Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa. Although it was too large and heavy for a small boy such as Teddy to carry properly, he dragged the book around the house, begging people to read it to him. Livingstone had left his native Scotland to devote his life to evangelism in South Africa, but he was much better known for his explorations of the African continent than for his religious work. Missionary Travels documented those exploits and was illustrated with detailed engravings. Roosevelt may have been too young to understand the words, but the pictures in Livingstone&#x2019;s book spoke clearly: a desperate man pinned to the earth by a snarling lion; men with spears and shields driving whole herds of zebras, elands, and antelope into giant pitfall traps dug into the earth; a dugout canoe being violently tipped by an enraged hippopotamus, the passengers flailing their arms and leaping to escape.<br><br>The man squirming under the lion&#x2019;s paw was David Livingstone himself. He had been trying to help some villagers by shooting one of the lions raiding their cattle corrals. Firing both barrels of his muzzle-loading rifle, he only wounded the lion, which charged him as he hastily reloaded. The animal sprang onto Livingstone, bit into his shoulder, and pulled him down to the ground. &#x201c;Growling horribly, he shook me as a terrier dog does a rat,&#x201d; Livingstone explained. &#x201c;It caused a sort of dreaminess, in which there was no sense of pain nor feeling of terror, though I was quite conscious of all that was happening.&#x201d;<br><br>Even more influential to young Teddy than Livingstone&#x2019;s writings were the books of novelist and adventurer Captain Thomas Mayne Reid, whose yarns of hunting, animal lore, and natural history were enormously popular during Roosevelt&#x2019;s youth. Described as adventure novels but also as juvenile scientific travelogues, Reid&#x2019;s writing displayed no stylistic pretensions, and he made it very clear that his books were written for boys. His accurate descriptions of the natural world&#x2014;everything from mammals and birds to plants&#x2014;became the mise-en-scï¿½ne of all Reid&#x2019;s books.<br><br>Reid championed the genre of the hunter-naturalists&#x2014;those intrepid men of the nineteenth century who were at once avid huntsmen and students of nature, and he counted himself among their ranks. &#x201c;I have ridden wildly with the hunter and strolled quietly with the&nbsp;naturalist,&#x201d; Reid explained. &#x201c;I excel not in the chase, I excel not in a knowledge of natural history&#x2014;but both I love.&#x201d; To Reid, the adventure of the hunt and the quiet study of nature were intimately connected.<br><br>One of Reid&#x2019;s books in particular must have been especially inspiring to young Roosevelt, presaging much of his naturalist career. The Boy Hunters details the lives of three brothers who are sent off by their father on an expedition to shoot a white buffalo for a great museum in Europe. Most important, Reid took the boys and their mission seriously, making very clear from the outset that they were capable of this feat. It&#x2019;s likely that Roosevelt&#x2019;s first impressions of naturalism were formed by countless hours spent with The Boy Hunters. Here were children free to roam outdoors in the fresh air all day. They traipsed through the woods with guns and knives; they were crack shots and fearlessly killed charging bears and menacing alligators. They collected gunnysacks full of specimens, preserving them in little natural-history museums of their own making.<br><br>Equally significantly for Roosevelt, Reid wrote about the father of these young hunters. Unable to join the hunt because of an old soldiering injury&#x2014;one that left him with a wooden leg&#x2014;the father sent his boys off on their buffalo-hunting expedition with a great sense of pride, boasting to his neighbors about his strong &#x201c;boy men.&#x201d;<br><br>How Theodore must have wanted to have such adventures; how he must have wanted his father to be proud of his bold and enterprising character. Trapped indoors on East 20th Street, Theodore could only read with rapture the novels of Thomas Mayne Reid and others, the sole antidote to his sickly life indoors. Adventure stories gave him an escape into a world full of exciting possibilities, but the excitement was always out of reach&#x2014;until he stumbled upon that dead seal on Broadway.<br><br>Years later, Roosevelt admitted in his autobiography that the moment he discovered the creature, all the stories he had read sprang to life before him. Adventure suddenly seemed attainable, and, for the first time, Roosevelt thought maybe he could pursue the life of a hunter-naturalist, just like a character in a Thomas Mayne Reid book.<br><br>Inspired, Roosevelt returned daily to that storefront to check on&nbsp;the dead seal. He tried to persuade the shopkeeper to give him the whole animal, but since the carcass was already starting to decay, young Theodore had to settle for just the head, which, perhaps together with a few equally pleased flies, he proudly carried home.<br><br>Roosevelt wanted to clean the seal head to save its skull, and from his readings he would have been familiar with at least some of the methods used for cleaning skulls. One technique is bacterial maceration, which requires placing the bone in a vat of warm water for days and weeks at a time. Bacteria gradually build up, rotting the meat off and turning the water into a brown mushy soup. This method literally stinks, and it is a slow, disgusting process. If Roosevelt prepared his seal skull using this technique, his parents would have shown unbelievable tolerance, especially in light of his mother&#x2019;s aversion to filth.<br><br>Another method involves placing the skull in a chamber of flesh-eating insects. Any invertebrate inclined to eat flesh will do, including ants, woodlice, or even maggots&#x2014;but flesh-eating beetles of the dermestid family are the most efficient. &#x201c;Bugging&#x201d; a skull yields superior results, because all those little mouthparts quickly pull flesh off without harming bone.<br><br>But Roosevelt most likely prepared his treasure by boiling it until the meat cooked off. Boiling is the fastest and most intuitive of all bone-cleaning methods, and there is an early reference to Roosevelt once asking a cook to boil a woodchuck carcass for him. The animal can&#x2019;t just be plopped into a pot and boiled intact; first the carcass has to be gutted and skinned, and the major muscle masses have to be carefully removed. Even after boiling, a certain amount of scraping is required to remove the last stubborn bits of gristle adhering tenaciously to bone, and the boiled brain still has to be sloshed out the back of the skull&#x2014;not an easy job for the squeamish.<br><br>Holding the finished skull in his hands, he would have seen for the first time how the seal&#x2019;s teeth worked&#x2014;lower molars interlocking neatly with the uppers. The suture lines&#x2014;the places where the different bones of the skull fuse together&#x2014;would have been obvious, and Roosevelt might have easily learned all the bones&#x2019; names: frontals, parietals, nasals, occipitals. He could estimate the size of the eyes by placing a ruler across their bony orbits. In the back of each eye socket&nbsp;he would have seen the tiny hole for the optic nerve to pass through to the brain. Inside the nose he would have seen the delicate, scroll-like bone that supports the membranes responsibl...</p><h2>The Nature of Boats: Insights and Esoterica for the Nautically Obsessed</h2><p>Boat noodling. Boat lovers suffer universally from this benign affliction. In its mildest form, boat noodling is nothing more than wondering why that sloop in the next slip is faster than yours. In a more significant manifestation it could mean serious daydreaming--drifting off for extended periods, sketching design ideas on the back of an envelope. Chances are, if you've picked up this book just to see what's in it, you're beyond help. <p>Naval architect Dave Gerr offers the perfect antidote, a browser's reference to understanding how boats tick: all you've ever wanted to know about boats--power and sail, racer and cruiser; dinghy and motoryacht. </p><p>In the clear, friendly, nontechnical style that has made his column for <i>Offshore</i> magazine so enduring and popular, Gerr explains everything from how thick a hull should be to why one sailboat tips less than another, from choosing an engine to designing a rig for your trawler yacht, from building a dinghy to simple rules of thumb for dozens of design quandaries. </p><p>Gerr writes for the boat noodler in all of us--those seriously interested in learning and dreaming about all types of watercraft. There is no better way to become a better sailor, equipped to handle any contingency. And there's no better place to start than right here.</p></p><p>Dave Gerr (rhymes with &#x201c;bear&#x201d;) is a naval architect who designs both yachts and commercial vessels. Gerr Marine has been in business since 1983 and has designed everything from dinghies to 60-foot around-the-world racing sailboats, an 82-foot aluminum voyaging motoryacht, and currently, redesign work on the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s nuclear submarines. Gerr is a contributing editor with Boatbuilder, Yachting, and Offshore magazines. HOMETOWN: New York, NYIt's quite obvious Gerr understands the weaknesses of those of us afflicted with a passion for boats. Furthermore, he trades on our insatiable appetite for nautical tidbits.

Her husband, a surgeon, saved her life on the spot, but when she was safely home she couldn&#x2019;t just go on with her life. She had entered an even more profound survival journey: the aftermath.<br><br> The survival experience changes everything because it invalidates all your previous adaptations, and the old rules don&#x2019;t apply. In some cases survivors suffer more in the aftermath than they did during the actual crisis. In all cases, they have to work hard to reinvent themselves. Drawing on gripping cases across a wide range of life-threatening experiences, Laurence Gonzales fashions a compelling argument about fear, courage, and the adaptability of the human spirit. Micki Glenn was later moved to say: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t regret that this happened to me. [It] has been . . . probably the single most positive experience I&#x2019;ve ever had.&#x201d;</p><p>Laurence Gonzales is the author of Surviving Survival, Flight 232, and the bestseller Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why.

It is the third of the three Theban plays but was the first written, chronologically. The play expands on the Theban legend that predated it and picks up where Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes ends. BOOK TWO Oedipus Rex, also known by its Greek title, Oedipus Tyrannus , or Oedipus the King, is an Athenian tragedy by Sophocles that was first performed around 429 BC.Originally, to the ancient Greeks, the title was simply Oedipus , as it is referred to by Aristotle in the Poetics. It is thought to have been renamed Oedipus Tyrannus to distinguish it from Oedipus at Colonus. In antiquity, the term &#x201c;tyrant&#x201d; referred to a ruler, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation. Of his three Theban plays that have survived, and that deal with the story of Oedipus, Oedipus Rex was the second to be written. However, in terms of the chronology of events that the plays describe, it comes first, followed by Oedipus at Colonus and then Antigone. BOOK THREE: Oedipus at Colonus is one of the three Theban plays of the Athenian tragedian Sophocles. It was written shortly before Sophocles' death in 406 BC and produced by his grandson (also called Sophocles) at the Festival of Dionysus in 401 BC. In the timeline of the plays, the events of Oedipus at Colonus occur after Oedipus the King and before Antigone; however, it was the last of Sophocles' three Theban plays to be written. The play describes the end of Oedipus' tragic life. Legends differ as to the site of Oedipus' death; Sophocles set the place at Colonus, a village near Athens and also Sophocles' own birthplace, where the blinded Oedipus has come with his daughters Antigone and Ismene as suppliants of the Erinyes and of Theseus, the king of Athens.</p><p>Three Theban Plays entitled Antigone, Oedipus the King, and Oedipus at Colonus.Theodore Howard Banks is at Wesleyan University.</p><h2>The Craft and Art of Clay</h2><p>Written by a well-known ceramist, this best-selling, comprehensive introduction to ceramics adeptly combines the <i>artist's</i> perspective and spirit of creative inspiration with step-by-step, fully illustrated instruction in the full range of hand, wheel, and plasterwork techniques.

Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation takes the perspective of the general manager at the product line, business unit, and corporate levels. The book not only examines each of these levels in some detail, but also addresses the interaction between the different levels of general management - for example, the fit between product strategy and business unit strategy, and the link between business and corporate level technology strategy. Each part of the book starts with an introductory chapter laying out an overall framework and offering a brief discussion of key tools and findings from existing literature. The remainder of each part offers a selected handful of seminar readings and case studies. Almost all of the cases deal with recent events and situations, including several that are concerned with the impact of the Internet.

Becker has written <i>the</i> classic book on how to conquer these pressures and simply write. First published nearly twenty years ago, <i>Writing for Social Scientists</i> has become a lifesaver for writers in all fields, from beginning students to published authors. Becker&#x2019;s message is clear: in order to learn how to write, take a deep breath and then begin writing. Revise. Repeat.<br> <br> It is not always an easy process, as Becker wryly relates. Decades of teaching, researching, and writing have given him plenty of material, and Becker neatly exposes the foibles of academia and its &#x201c;publish or perish&#x201d; atmosphere. Wordiness, the passive voice, inserting a &#x201c;the way in which&#x201d; when a simple &#x201c;how&#x201d; will do&#x2014;all these mechanisms are a part of the social structure of academic writing.

It examines both the traditional areas of the field as well as recent findings, showing how social psychologists apply their discipline to help solve significant social problems -- including those relevant to students&#39; everyday lives.PREFACE <p> A glance at any daily newspaper illustrates the extremes of human social behavior. We see violence, heroics, war, political scandal, terrorism, bravery, and a multitude of other manifestations of the extraordinary range of social conduct. At the same time, our own personal livesï¿½involving friends, family, neighbors, lovers, acquaintances, and even chance encounters with total strangersï¿½reflect the stuff of social behavior. </p> <p> Each of our experiences with our social environment raises a host of questions. What are the sources and consequences of kindness and cruelty? Why and how are people susceptible to the influence of others? How do we develop and maintain our relationships with other individuals? How do people come to grips with the meaning of their social environment? How does our culture influence our behavior? </p> <p> The discipline of social psychology addresses such questions. Embracing a vast range of human behavior, the field seeks to answer the fundamental issues that underlie our social world. It is a discipline that holds the promise of providing real improvements in the human condition. </p> <p> The central challenge in writing an introduction to social psychology is to capture the essence of a dynamic, ever-changing discipline. Social psychology must be presented in a way that fosters readers' intrinsic interest in social psychological phenomenon, doing so with scientific integrity and accuracy. THE GOALS OF THIS BOOK </p> <p> To meet this challenge, the third edition of Social Psychology has been written keeping in mind three major goals. First and foremost, it provides a broad, balanced overview of social psychology. It introduces readers to the theories, research, and applications that constitute the discipline, examining both the traditional areas of the field as well as more recent innovations. The book pays particular attention to the applications developed by social psychologists. While not slighting theoretical material, the text emphasizes what social psychologists know and how this knowledge may be applied to real-world problems. In fact, the very structure of the book is designed to make the applied material as prominent as the theoretical material by integrating more applied chapters throughout the text, rather than relegating them to the end of the book. </p> <p> The second major goal of the text is to explicitly tie social psychology to students' lives. The findings of social psychologists have a significant degree of relevance to students, and this text illustrates how these findings can be applied in a meaningful, practical sense. For instance, applications are presented within a contemporaneous framework. The book includes current news items, timely world events, and contemporary uses of social psychology that are designed to draw readers into the field. Numerous descriptive scenarios and vignettes reflect everyday situations in students' lives, explaining how they relate to social psychology. For example, each chapter begins with an opening prologue that provides a real-life situation relating to the chapter subject area. This scenario is reconsidered at the end of the chapter, where integrative, critical-thinking questions tie the prologue to the chapter content. Furthermore, all chapters also have The Informed Consumer of Social Psychology section, which explicitly suggests ways to apply social psychological findings to students' experiences. Each chapter also includes a feature called Applying Social Psychology that discusses ways social psychology research is being used to answer problems of an applied nature. </p> <p> Finally, the third goal of the text is to make the field of social psychology engaging, accessible, and interesting to students. The book is user friendly and written in a direct, conversational voice, meant to replicate as much as possible a dialogue between author and student. </p> <p> Social Psychology, third edition, is a text that students can understand and master on their own, without the intervention of an instructor. To that end, it includes a variety of pedagogical features. Each chapter contains a Looking Ahead overview that sets the stage for the chapter, a running glossary, a numbered summary, a list of key terms and concepts, and an epilogue. In addition, each chapter has three Review and Rethink sections that provide enumeration of the key concepts and questions that promote and test critical thinking. </p> <p> In short, Social Psychology seeks to blend and integrate theory, research, and applications. Rather than concentrating on a few isolated areas and presenting them in great depth, the emphasis is on illustrating the breadth of social psychology. Concentrating on the scope of the field permits the examination of a variety of evolving and nontraditional areas of social psychology. Finally, the text seeks to illustrate social psychology as it now stands and is evolving, rather than providing a detailed historical record of the development of social psychology. While covering the classic studies, the decided emphasis is on the field in its current state. </p> <p> Ultimately, this text seeks to provide a broad-based overview of social psychology, emphasizing its theories, research, and applications. It is meant to show the relevance of social psychology to students' lives while acquainting them with the scientific basis of the discipline. It is designed to be a user-friendly text, one that captures the excitementï¿½and promiseï¿½of a growing, developing scientific field. </p> <p> CHAPTER-OPENING PROLOGUES<br> Each chapter begins with a short vignette that describes an individual or situation that is representative of basic social psychological phenomena. For instance, chapter prologues tie descriptions of ethnic cleansing, James Byrd Jr.'s murder at the hands of white extremists, and a couple falling in love to social psychological principles presented in their respective chapters. </p> <p> APPLYING SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY<br> This feature, found in every chapter, describes current social psychological research or research issues applied to everyday problems. They include descriptions of ambivalent stereotyping, the slime effect (explaining why we dislike likeable behavior), and attitude change over the course of the life span. </p> <p> SPEAKING OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY<br> These boxes report interviews that were conducted with people who use the findings of social psychology, either explicitly or implicitly, in their work. For the most part, interviewees are not social psychologists but rather people whose professions employ social psychological findings. For example, interviewees include a newspaper reporter (social cognition), an advertising executive who uses celebrity endorsements (interpersonal attraction), and a trial consultant (law and politics). </p> <p> SOCIAL.WEB<br> Four essays describing the impact of technology and the World Wide Web are interspersed throughout the book. These include discussions of the impact of violent video games, finding love in cyberspace, use of email, and social stigmas. </p> <p> EXPLORING DIVERSITY<br> These sections, integrated within every chapter, highlight issues relevant to the multicultural society in which we live. They illustrate social psychological issues relevant to race, ethnicity, and culture. For example, various Exploring Diversity sections examine cultural influences in attribution, cultural determinations of health, ethnic differences regarding the stigma of obesity, relationships among gay and lesbian couples, and gender and cultural patterns of leadership. </p> <p> THE INFORMED CONSUMER OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY<br> Every chapter includes information on specific uses that can be derived from research conducted by social psychologists. For example, various chapters discuss how to draw appropriate conclusions from others' behavior, overcome stereotypes, deal with anger, and resist persuasion. </p> <p> REVIEW AND RETHINK<br> Interspersed throughout each chapter are three short recaps of the chapters' main points, followed by questions designed to provoke critical thinking. </p> <p> SOCIAL LINKS COMPANION WEBSITE (CW)<br> These marginal icons indicate that relevant material can be found on the World Wide Web by going to the Feldman Social Psychology Website (prenhall/feldman). By referring to the specific book page where the Social Link is found, readers will find a link to a relevant Web page. </p> <p> END-OF-CHAPTER MATERIAL<br> Each chapter ends with a numbered summary (Looking Back), list of key terms and concepts, and an epilogue containing critical-thinking questions about the chapter-opening vignette. WHAT'S NEW IN THIS EDITION? </p> <p> A considerable number of new topics and areas have been added to the third edition. For instance, advances in such areas as culture, emotions, close relationships, psychophysiology.; and evolutionary approaches to social phenomenon receive expanded and new coverage. </p> <p> In addition, a wealth of contemporary research is cited in this edition. Hundreds of new research citations have been added, most from the last few years. A sampling of topics either newly included in this edition or expanded also illustrate</p></p><h2>Calculus For Dummies</h2><p><p><b><i>Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition (9781118791295) is now being published as Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition (9781119293491).

But by the late 1960s and &#x2019;70s many regarded Baldwin as being out of sync with the political and social currents transforming America: too integrationist for Black Arts Movement writers and others on the Left, yet too &#x201c;pessimistic&#x201d; for many white readers, and as a result his later novels have never received the consideration given his earlier fiction. Sober in outlook but ambitious in scope, these works show Baldwin responding with his signature passion&#x2014;for music, for justice, for life&#x2014;and searching intelligence to the new realities of a rapidly changing cultural landscape, as the Movement era gives way to the age of identity politics that we still live in today. This culminating volume in the Library of America edition of his fiction illustrates how Baldwin continues to be relevant in twenty-first-century America, especially in his dramatizing of the unequal treatment of black men by the police and the justice system, his nuanced depictions of the black family, and his explorations of sexuality.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

But I am reasonably certain that a sensitive reader who journeys through How It Is will leave the book convinced that Beckett says more that is relevant to experience in our time than Shakespeare does in Macbeth. It should come as no surprise if a decade or so hence How It Is is appraised as a masterpiece of modern literature. This poetic novel is Beckett at his height.&#x201d; Webster Schott<br><br> A wonderful book, written in the sparest prose. . . .

A wonderful book, written in the sparest of prose.Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin in 1906 and graduated from Trinity College. He settled in Paris in 1937, after travels in Germany and periods of residence in London and Dublin. He remained in France during the Second World War and was active in the French Resistance. From the spring of 1946 his plays, novels, short fiction, poetry and criticism were largely written in French. With the production of En attendant Godot in Paris in 1953, Beckett&#39;s work began to achieve widespread recognition. During his subsequent career as a playwright and novelist in both French and English he redefined the possibilities of prose fiction and writing for the theatre. Samuel Beckett won the Prix Formentor in 1961 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. He died in Paris in December 1989.</p><h2>Generalist Social Work Practice: An Empowering Approach (7th Edition) (Connecting Core Competencies)</h2><p><p> </p> <b> <i> <p>An empowerment-based method of social work which integrates core themes of the profession.</p> </i></b><p><b><i> </i> </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>This text is part of the Connecting Core Competencies Series.</p> <p> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Generalist Social Work Practice, </i>7th edition, fully integrates core social work themes of collaboration, the strengths perspective, values and ethics, social justice and human rights, evidence-based practice, cultural competence, and policy practice. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This text offers a progressive practice approach grounded in social work research, reflective of social work values, sensitive to client diversity, and applicable to work with any level of client system including individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities.&nbsp; Beginning with engaging clients as partners and continuing with assessing, intervening, and evaluating from a strengths perspective, this approach offers social workers a method that fully realizes core social work values, respects client competence, and activates client resources within the context of their lives. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All parts of the practice process are described in detail, connected to social work theory, illustrated with case examples, and supported with evidence from social work research.

The symbols represent sounds, yet they exist in their own right, often invested with quasi-magical power. This book examines the many imaginative, often idiosyncratic ways in which the letters of the alphabet have been assigned value in political, spiritual, or religious belief systems over two millennia. The birth of writing was linked to religion and cosmology and was endowed with semi-divine status. Plato saw letter-forms as reflecting ideas, while the Pythagoreans assimilated them to number-theory. The Greeks employed letters for occult and divinatory purposes, while the Romans used them in more practical ways, such as the invention of shorthand. The Middle Ages saw the rise of further theories about letters in Christian philosophy, alchemy and Kabbalah. Theories of their divine origin and mystical significance continued into the 18th and 19th centuries, becoming involved with nationalism and revolutionary political theory. In our own day letters of the alphabet are the subject of scholarly research, and inspiration to graphic artists and a fertile field for mystical speculation. This book explores this realm, and should be of interest to cultural historians, art historians, and anyone interested in the history of typography.</p><p>Long regarded as a divine gift, the alphabet has been seen not just as a collection of arbitrary signs but as the direct visual embodiment of meaning. Pythagoreans, Kabbalists, neo-Platonists, and medieval Catholic mystics regarded the alphabet as a code that explained the universe. Drucker (art history, Yale) examines these and other ideas about the origins and inherent meanings of the alphabet, relating them to their intellectual milieu. She also discusses developments in the forms of the letters. She notes, for example, how modern typefaces, first developed in the late 18th century, embody Enlightenment philosophy. Her well-written discussion is enriched with over 300 illustrations drawn from important texts and documents. A major study in the history of books and the history of ideas; recommended for academic and public libraries alike.<br><i>Joseph Rosenblum, Guilford Technical Community Coll., Jamestown, N.C.</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Language is devoted to articulation, but the inarticulate elements from which it is composed -- bare forked letters, decaying sounds -- have long teased the human imagination as something at once unnacountable and provocative: a threat of utter incoherence underlying all linguistic expression; a token of some final as yet undisclosed revelation. Drucker, an author of many accomplishments, a poet, novelist, art historian, and printer, has written a history of alphabetic forms and speculations. She limits herself to the West, but needless to say that still leaves a lot to consider. Uncials, historiated capitals, alchemical codes, and the Kabbalah are all here. This is a fine and suggestive survey, thoroughly researched, handsomely illustrated, somewhat detached in tone -- which is odd: the author loves her subject; she needn't have struggled so hard to hide it. <br><i>Copyright ï¿½ 1996, Boston Review.

Users will be prepared for more intensive work in each topic through these applications and their accompanying exercises. Chapter topics under the abstract analysis heading include: the real numbers, series, the topology of R^n, functions, normed vector spaces, differentiation and integration, and limits of functions. Applications cover approximation by polynomials, discrete dynamical systems, differential equations, Fourier series and physics, Fourier series and approximation, wavelets, and convexity and optimization. For math enthusiasts with a prior knowledge of both calculus and linear algebra.</p><p><p> This book provides an introduction both to real analysis and to a range of important applications that require this material. More than half the book is a series of essentially independent chapters covering topics from Fourier series and polynomial approximation to discrete dynamical systems and convex optimization. Studying these applications can, we believe, both improve understanding of real analysis and prepare for more intensive work in each topic. There is enough material to allow a choice of applications and to support courses at a variety of levels. </p> <p> The first part of the book covers the basic machinery of real analysis, focusing on that part needed to treat the applications. This material is organized to allow a streamlined approach that gets to the applications quickly, or a more wide-ranging introduction. To this end, certain sections have been marked as enrichment topics or as advanced topics to suggest that they might be omitted. It is our intent that the instructor will choose topics judiciously in order to leave sufficient time for material in the second part of the book. </p> <p> A quick look at the table of contents should convince the reader that applications are more than a passing fancy in this book. Material has been chosen from both classical and modern topics of interest in applied mathematics and related fields. Our goal is to discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these applied areas concentrating on the role of fundamental principles of analysis. This is not a methods course, although some familiarity with the computational or methods-oriented aspects of these topics may help the student appreciate how the topics are developed. In each application, we have attempted to get to a number of substantial results and to show how these results depend on the fundamental ideas of real analysis. In particular, the notions of limit and approximation are two sides of the same coin, and this interplay is central to the whole book. </p> <p> We emphasize the role of normed vector spaces in analysis, as they provide a natural framework for most of the applications. This begins early with a separate treatment of <b>R</b><i>n</i>. Normed vector spaces are introduced to study completeness and limits of functions. There is a separate chapter on metric spaces that we use as an opportunity to put in a few more sophisticated ideas. This format allows its omission, if need be. </p> <p> The basic ideas of calculus are covered carefully, as this level of rigour is not generally possible in a first calculus course. One could spend a whole semester doing this material, which forms the basis of many standard analysis courses today. When we have taught a course from these notes, however, we have often chosen to omit topics such as the basics of differentiation and integration on tile grounds that these topics have been covered adequately for many students. The goal of getting further into the applications chapters may make it worth cutting here. </p> <p> We have treated only tangentially some topics commonly covered in real analysis texts, such as multivariate calculus or a brief development of the Lebesgue integral. To cover this material in an accessible way would have left no time, even in a one-year course, for the real goal of the book. Nevertheless, we deal throughout with functions on domains in <b>R</b><i>n</i>, and we do manage to deal with issues of higher dimensions without differentiability. For example, the chapter on convexity and optimization yields some deep results on "nonsmooth" analysis that contain the standard differentiable results such as Lagrange multipliers. This is possible because the subject is based on directional derivatives, an essentially one-variable idea. Ideas from multivariate calculus appear once or twice in the advanced sections, such as the use of Green's Theorem in the section on the isoperimetric inequality. </p> <p> Not covering measure theory was another conscious decision to keep the material accessible and to keep the size of the book under control. True, we do make use of the <i>L</i>2 norm and do mention the <i>L</i><i>P</i> spaces because these are important ideas. We feel, however, that the basics of Fourier series, approximation theory, and even wavelets can be developed while keeping measure theory to a minimum. Of course, this does not mean we think that the subject is unimportant. Rather we wished to aim the book at an undergraduate audience. To deal partially with some of the issues that arise here, we have included a section on metric space completion. This allows a treatment of <i>L</i><i>P</i> spaces as complete spaces of bona fide functions, by means of the Daniell jntegral. This is certainly an enrichment topic, which can be used to motivate the need for measure theory and to satisfy curious students. </p> <p> This book began in 1984 when the first author wrote a short set of course notes (120 pages) for a real analysis class at the University of Waterloo designed for students who came primarily from applied math and computer science. The idea was to get to the basic results of analysis quickly and then illustrate their role in a variety of applications. At that time, the applications were limited to polynomial approximation, Newton's method, differential equations, and Fourier series. </p> <p> A plan evolved to expand these notes into a textbook suitable for one semester or a year-long course. We expanded both the theoretical section and the choice of applications in order to make the text more flexible. As a consequence, the text is not uniformly difficult. The material is arranged by topic, and generally each chapter gets more difficult as one progresses through it. The instructor can choose to omit some more difficult topics in the chapters on abstract analysis if they will not be needed later. We provide a flow chart indicating the topics in abstract analysis required for each part of the applications chapters. For example, the chapter on limits of functions begins with the basic notion of uniform convergence and the fundamental result that the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous. It ends with much more difficult material, such as the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. Even if one plans to do the chapter on differential equations, it is possible to stop before the last section on Peano's Theorem, where the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem is needed. So both topics can be conveniently omitted. Although one cannot proceed linearly through the text, we hope there is some compensation in demonstrating that, even at a high level, there is a continued interplay between theory and application. </p> <p> The background assumed for using this text is decent courses in both calculus and linear algebra. What we expect is outlined in the background chapter. A student should have a reasonable working knowledge of differential and integral calculus. Multivariable calculus is an asset because of the increased level of sophistication and the incorporation of linear algebra; it is not essential. We certainly expect that the student is used to working with exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions. Linear algebra is needed because we treat <b>R</b><i>n</i>, <i>C(X)</i>, and <i>L</i>2 (-&#x3c0;, &#x3c0;) as vector spaces. We develop the notion of norms on vector spaces as an important tool for measuring convergence. As such, the reader should be comfortable with the notion of a basis in finite-dimensional spaces. Familiarity with linear transformations is also sometimes useful. A course that introduces the student to proofs would also be an asset. Although we have attempted to address this in the background chapter (Chapter 1), we have no illusions that this text would be easy for a student having no prior experience with writing proofs. </p> <p> While this background is in principle enough for the whole book, sections marked with a require additional mathematical maturity or are not central to the main development, and sections marked with a * are more difficult yet. By and large, the various applications are independent of each other. However, there are references to material in other chapters. For example, in the wavelets chapter (Chapter 15), it seems essential to make comparisons with the classical approximation results for Fourier series and for polynomials. </p> <p> It is also possible to use an application chapter on its own for a student seminar or other topics course. We have included several modern topics of interest in addition to the classical subjects of applied mathematics. The chapter on discrete dynamical systems (Chapter 11) introduces the notions of chaos and fractals and develops a number of examples. The chapter on wavelets (Chapter 15) illustrates the ideas with the Haar wavelet. It continues with a construction of wavelets of compact support, and gives a complete treatment of a somewhat easier continuous wavelet. In the final chapter (Chapter 16), we study convex optimization and convex programming. Both of these latter chapters require more linear algebra than the others. </p> <p> We would like to thank various people who worked with early versions of this book for their helpful comments; in particular, Robert Andre, John Baker, Brian Forrest, John Holbrook, David Seigel, and Frank Zorzitto.

On July 4, 2012, the long-sought Higgs Boson--aka &#34;the God Particle&#34;--was discovered at the world&#39;slargest particle accelerator, the LHC, in Geneva, Switzerland. On March 14, 2013, physicists at CERN confirmed it. This elusive subatomic particle forms a field that permeates the entire universe, creating the masses of the elementary particles that are the basic building blocks of everything in the known world--from viruses to elephants, from atoms to quasars. Starting where Nobel Laureate Leon Lederman&#39;s bestseller The God Particle left off, this incisive new book explains what&#39;s next. Lederman and Hill discuss key questions that will occupy physicists for years to come: * Why were scientists convinced that something like the &#34;God Particle&#34; had to exist? * What new particles, forces, and laws of physics lie beyond the &#34;God Particle&#34;? * What powerful new accelerators are now needed for the US to recapture a leadership role in science and to reach &#34;beyond the God Particle,&#34; such as Fermilab&#39;s planned Project-X and the Muon Collider? Using thoughtful, witty, everyday language, the authors show how all of these intriguing questions are leading scientists ever deeper into the fabric of nature.

(<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>In his introduction to The Great Code ( LJ 6/1/82), Frye promised a sequel to his work on "the Bible and literature." Here is the promised volume, though it is not an entirely new book. In Part 1, Frye restates his critical position, his structural principle: the identity of mythology and literature. In Part 2, he focuses on specific mythological themes (mountain, garden, cave, furnace) that are variations of the cosmic axis mundi image. Throughout, he demonstrates his interest in the mythological structures that inform literature, including the Bible, instead of simply the literary characteristics of the Bible. While it is undeniable that myths often serve as structuring elements in the Bible, occasionally Frye allows myth criticism to overwhelm the text rather than shed light upon it.

Smith prepares the way for a new approach to the comparative study of religion.<br> <br> Smith stresses the importance of place&#x2014;in particular, constructed ritual environments&#x2014;to a proper understanding of the ways in which "empty" actions become rituals. He structures his argument around the territories of the Tjilpa aborigines in Australia and two sites in Jerusalem&#x2014;the temple envisioned by Ezekiel and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The first of these locales&#x2014;the focus of one of the more important contemporary theories of religious ritual&#x2014;allows Smith to raise questions concerning the enterprise of comparison. His close examination of Eliade's influential interpretation of the Tjilpa tradition leads to a powerful critique of the approach to religion, myth, and ritual that begins with cosmology and the category of "The Sacred."<br> <br> In substance and in method, <i>To Take Place</i> represents a significant advance toward a theory of ritual. It is of great value not only to historians of religion and students of ritual, but to all, whether social scientists or humanists, who are concerned with the nature of place.<br> <br> "This book is extraordinarily stimulating in prompting one to think about the ways in which space, or place, is perceived, marked, and utilized religiously. . . . A provocative example of the application of humanistic geography to our understanding of what <i>takes place</i> in religion."&#x2014;Dale Goldsmith, <i>Interpretation<br> <br></i></p></p><p><b>Jonathan Z.

Although he studied law at Paris, he devoted his life entirely to writing. His most popular stories, besides <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i> (1870), include: <i>Five Weeks in a Balloon</i> (1863), <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i> (1864), <i>A Trip to the Moon</i> (1865), <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> (1872), and <i>Michael Strogoff</i> (1876). In addition, he was the author of a number of successful plays, as well as a popular history of exploration from Phoenician times to the mid-nineteenth century, <i>The Discovery of the Earth</i> (1878-80). After a long and active career in literature, Jules Verne died at Amiens, France, in 1905.<br>Isaac Asimov authored over 400 books in a career that lasted nearly 50 years. As a leading scientific writer, historian, and futurist, he covered a variety of subjects ranging from mathematics to humor, and won numerous awards for his work.</p><h2>Maxfield Parrish: 1870-1966</h2><p>Maxfield Parrish was one of the most popular American artists of the 20th century. His engaging covers for <i>Scribners</i> and <i>Life</i>, murals such as Old King Cole and the Pied Piper, and posters, calendars, and paintings have delighted viewers for over 100 years. This is the first critical examination of Parrish's place in the history of American art and culture.</p><p>Maxfield Parrish, the prodigiously gifted, turn-of-the-20th-century illustrator famous for his limpid blue landscapes and dreamy pubescent models draped in gossamer threads, has rolled in and out of artistic favor for nearly a century. In 1964, critic Lawrence Alloway wrote about Parrish's odd place in the history of American art: "He was the most popular artist the country ever produced, with prints in a quarter of all American homes at one time; and yet his kitschy compositions were considered risible among the educated art elite." Parrish himself had a sophisticated sense of his own place in the pantheon: "There are countless artists whose shoes I am not worthy to polish whose prints would not pay the printer," he wrote. "The question of judgement is a puzzling one." But new movements of the 1960s, including photo-realism and pop art, led to critical reappraisal of Parrish's oeuvre, and a few of the later new image painters, such as Joan Nelson, found sweet inspiration in his atmospheric skies and evocative, shadowy forests. <p> Parrish is finally receiving his due with this truly intelligent, fascinating book. It is the catalog to a traveling exhibition organized by the author, Sylvia Yount, the curator of collections at the Museum of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia--Parrish's alma mater and hometown, respectively. With Mark F. Bockrather, a conservator who elucidates Parrish's formidable craftsmanship, Yount has done a fine job of resurrecting Parrish yet again. She offers a sensitive analysis of the place his pastoral, idyllic, storybook innocence played in a world that Freud, the Great War, the Depression, and yet another world war inexorably tore to shreds. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>During most of his life, Maxfield Parrish was the most popular American artist, bar none. He is still popular; in 1996, his <i>Daybreak</i>reproductions of which are said to have been in one-fourth of all 1920s American households--sold at auction for $4.3 million. Yount recounts Parrish's career efficiently, relating his work to the development of commercial and gallery art alike without downplaying its distinctiveness and demotic appeal. Deprecated as kitsch by midcentury critics, Parrish's most familiar images, created to illustrate calendars, were of lissome young women posing ecstatically on rocky promontories before glowing, fantastically colored skies. Book illustration and murals occupied his early career, landscapes his later years. How and why he achieved the high-gloss intensity of his colors are the subjects of a fascinating pendant to Yount's main text by Mark F. Bockrath. The exhibition that this resplendent art book catalogs won't travel south of Philadelphia or west of Rochester, New York, but there is no good reason for the book not to reach libraries, not to mention hearts, throughout America. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Gift to be Simple: Life in the Amish Country</h2><p>Few photographers can boast of acceptance by and access to a remote Amish community, but Bill Coleman has had the good fortune to spend the past 25 years capturing its daily events in beautiful full-color images. From breadmaking to haymaking to community barn raisings, he takes readers on a visual journey through a Pennsylvanian valley largely untouched by tourists and the trappings of modern existence. Whether it&#39;s a buggy traversing a winter farmscape, a woman quilting, or a group of children at play, Coleman captures with a perceptive eye the one unique and telling gesture that reveals the character of an individual and a community. The images gathered here--authentic in their subject matter and utterly simple in their presentation--celebrate the beauty and grace of a time-honored way of life.</p><p>Bill Coleman a professional photographer who lives in State College, PennsylvaniaTwenty-five years ago, professional photographer Coleman helped reset a wheel on an Amish farmer's buggy. In return, the farmer invited Coleman to visit--an unusual thing for anyone from the very self-contained Amish community to do. Coleman became a regular visitor and learned how to photograph inoffensively that particular Amish aggregation, which avoids the ways of the world more rigorously than do many others. Some results of his persistence constitute this lovely album, and they rank with George Tice's pictures in the classic <i>Fields of Peace</i> (rev. ed., 1998). Whereas Tice printed his work in sepia to lend the images the monumentality he found in Edwin S. Curtis' famous sepia photos of American Indians, Coleman conjures the same largeness of spirit with a palette full of the velvety hues of various cloudy skies and the earth tones of farmland. Because the community he worked with discourages portraiture of adults, Coleman only shows the faces of children. Their innocent beauty suggests that this kind of simplicity is a gift all children should share. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Bryn Mawr Classical Review</p><h2>Romans: God&#39;s Good News for the World (The Bible Speaks Today)</h2><p>John Stott joins a chorus of distinguished voices of the church who have pondered and lived the great themes of Romans, and who have tuned our ears to hear its rich harmonies and meditate on its broad vision. In the classic tradition of great Christian leaders who have commented on Romans, Stott expounds Paul's words, themes and arguments. The power of the gospel, the righteousness of God revealed from heaven, is clearly addressed to today's men and women who have answered its summons.<br>Not only is Stott deeply acquainted with the text and context of Romans, he is also conversant with the most recent Pauline scholarship. But more important, he views Romans from his own pastoral and missionary perspective, an outlook shaped in turn by the great vision of the apostle. Here is a commentary for those who live on the edge of the third millennium, a commentary spanning the two worlds of Romans - Paul's and ours.</p><p>Stott, Rector Emeritus of All Souls' Church in London and revered figure in evangelicalism, is the author of many prior books, and little new ground is broken in this study as a result. But the freshness of Stott's style and the comprehensiveness of his work in this volume suggest that it may well become a standard anyway. Stott distills the many themes of Romans into two main ideas: the mercy of God as displayed in the cross of Christ and in the Calvinistic doctrine of election; and the essential unity of all Christian believers. He engages evenhandedly many respected commentators whose positions are both to the left and the right of his own. Just as importantly, he makes St. Paul's diatribic form of argumentation come alive in very human and understandable form. Readers can almost hear the give-and-take of ferocious disputation; and scholars and students alike will find the writing congenial and challenging. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Crucified God: 40th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><p>From its English publication in 1973, Jurgen Moltmann's <i>The Crucified God</i> garnered much attention, and it has become one of the seminal texts of twentieth-century theology. Following up on his groundbreaking <i>Theology of Hope, The Crucified God</i> established the cross as the foundation for Christian hope. Moltmann's dramatic innovation was to see the cross not as a problem of theodicy but instead as an act of ultimate solidarity between God and humanity. In this, he drew on liberation theology, and he was among the first to bring third-world theologies into a first-world context.</p><p>Moltmann proposes that suffering is not a problem to be solved but instead that suffering is an aspect of God's very being: God is love, and love invariably involves suffering. In this view, the crucifixion of Jesus is an event that affects the entirety of the Trinity, showing that <i>The Crucified God</i> is more than an arresting titleit is a theological breakthrough.</p></p><p>Jurgen Moltmann studied Christian theology in England and, after his return to Germany, in Gottingen. He served as a pastor from 1952 till 1958 in Bremen. From 1967 he was professor of systematic theology at the University of Tubingen until he retired in 1994. Among his many influential and award-winning books are The Theology of Hope (1967), The Crucified God (1974), The Trinity and the Kingdom (1981), The Spirit of Life (1994), and The Coming of God (1996), winner of the Grawemeyer Award in 2000.</p><h2>North and South</h2><p>When her father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale is uprooted from her comfortable home in Hampshire to move with her family to the north of England. Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction. In &#34;North and South&#34;, Elizabeth Gaskell skillfully fused individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale created one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Lacking marketed products or substantial profit, the firm nonetheless saw its share price escalate from $35 to $89 in the first few minutes of trading, at that point the largest gain in stock market history. Coming at a time of economic recession and declining technological competitiveness in the United States, the event provoked banner headlines and ignited a period of speculative frenzy over biotechnology as a revolutionary means for creating new and better kinds of pharmaceuticals, untold profit, and a possible solution to national economic malaise.</p> <p> </p> <p>Drawing from an unparalleled collection of interviews with early biotech players, Sally Smith Hughes offers the first book-length history of this pioneering company, depicting Genentech&#x2019;s improbable creation, precarious youth, and ascent to immense prosperity. Hughes provides intimate portraits of the people significant to Genentech&#x2019;s science and business, including cofounders Herbert Boyer and Robert Swanson, and in doing so sheds new light on how personality affects the growth of science. By placing Genentech&#x2019;s founders, followers, opponents, victims, and beneficiaries in context, Hughes also demonstrates how science interacts with commercial and legal interests and university research, and with government regulation, venture capital, and commercial profits.</p> <p> </p> <p>Integrating the scientific, the corporate, the contextual, and the personal, <i>Genentech</i> tells the story of biotechnology as it is not often told, as a risky and improbable entrepreneurial venture that had to overcome a number of powerful forces working against it. </p></p><p><p><b>Sally Smith Hughes</b> is a historian of science at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.

In 1777, the Tavern hosted America's first official Fourth of July celebration. And in 1789, this landmark inn held a banquet for George Washington as he passed through Philadelphia en route to New York for his presidential inauguration.Through the Revolutionary period and the early republic, City Tavern was the center of American political and social life. More than a meeting place for prominent Americans, the Tavern also acquired a reputation as the best restaurant in North America, the setting for suppers, as elegant as was ever laid on a table,&#x201d; according to John Adams. Since Philadelphia's seaport was the lively center of eighteenth-century commerce, it's no surprise that it was here that the finest imported foodstuffs, Madeiras, clarets, and exotic fruits and spices met the bounty of the New World, giving the City Tavern chef an unlimited supply of ingredients.More than two hundred years later, the Tavern is still garnering high praise for its gourmet cuisine and elegant atmosphere. The fusion of classic European cookery, American game and produce, and exotic island spices enjoyed by early visitors to the Tavern is recreated every day by chef/proprietor Walter Staib.<i>City Tavern Cookbook</i> reveals the richness and diversity of the eighteenth-century table. Within these pages are 200 authentic recipes that capture the best of early American gourmet cuisine. These dishes, updated for modern tastes, include world-famous West Indies Pepper Pot Soup, Roasted Duckling with Peach Chutney, Lobster Potpie, Thomas Jefferson's Sweet Potato Biscuits, plus Martha Washington's Chocolate Mousse Cake. With fascinating historic tidbits and trivia that bring eighteenth-century American gastronomy to life, <i>City Tavern Cookbook</i> offers the reader a delicious lesson in culinary history.</p><p>Chef <b>Walter Staib</b> is the highly acclaimed chef and proprietor of Philadelphia's celebrated City Tavern restaurant.

Written by Ivan McBeth, the cofounder of Vermont's Green Mountain School of Druidry, with Fearn Lickfield, the book incorporates lessons, visualizations, rituals, and magical stories. Many different activities and exercises are included that provide the reader with hands-on learning. Ivan also provides personal stories that demonstrate his own journey from spiritual seeker to Druid.</p></p><p><b>Ivan McBeth</b>, a Druid in the Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids (OBOD), founded the Green Mountain Druid Order, a modern mystery school based in Worcester, Vermont with his partner Fearn Lickfield. Ivan's passion was the creation of sacred space, especially stone circles. A founding member of the Circles for Peace project in the United States, he was co-responsible for the Burlington Earth Clock and 25 other full-sized stone circles around the world, including the large Swan Circle on the site of the Glastonbury Music Festival in the UK and the Kinstones in Wisconsin. Ivan died in 2016."This book is a paean of love for the Earth from a great smiling bear of a man. Such was Ivan McBeth. There are as many types of Druidism as there are Druids in this world, and in this book Ivan outlines what I call "Druidry of the Spirit", the path of the Heart from an English Druid's perspective. Anyone who wants to learn about modern Druids will benefit from this volume as will those following the path of Nature Spirituality. After reading the book they will never look at the Sacred Land the same way again." --<b>Ellen Evert Hopman</b>, Archdruid of Tribe of the Oak, and author of <i>A Legacy of Druids: Conversations with Druid Leaders from Britain, the USA and Canada</i>, <i>Tree Medicine Tree Magic</i>, and other volumes<br><br>"Ivan fully lived and embodied the Spirit of the Lord of the Dance and the Greening Power of Nature, and his joyous creativity is a testament to the simple wisdom and truth at the core of his beliefs, practices and teachings. I commend Ivan to anyone who would dance with the sun and the moon and the web of the world and find joy there." --<b>Dr. Patrick MacManaway</b>, author of <i>Dowsing for Health, Cultivating the Light Body</i>, and <i>Keys to Grace</i>, and is the co-founder of Circles of Peace<br><br>"Ivan McBeth, has always meant three things to me: good friend, thoughtful wisdom, and world's foremost stone circle builder. Bigger than life, he needed two chapters in my book <i>Stone Circles: A Modern Builder's Guide</i>. He wouldn't fit in one. But it's the thoughtful wisdom, a lifetime's worth, that Ivan's posthumous book is all about. If you want to take up Druidry, or are curious about how it would grace your life -- and that of Gaia, our planet -- this book is the place to start." --<b>Rob Roy</b>, director of Earthwood Building School and author of 17 books including <i>Cordwood Building</i>, www.cordwoodmasonry.com<br><br>"<i>The Bardic Book of Becoming</i> is a book modern Druids have needed for a long time. Deeply visionary, it offers a look into the spirituality of modern Druidic practice and the underlying beliefs and ideas which sustain it. I would recommend this not only to Druids everywhere, but to all those wishing to know more of this growing spiritual practice." --<b>John Matthews</b>, author of <i>The Druid Source Book</i> and <i>Celtic Shamanism</i><br><br>"<i>The Bardic Book of Becoming</i> bubbles with vibrancy and creativity, as did its author. A book of Druid basics, it glints with deeper wisdom. I don't agree with every word, but wholly concur with its shimmering intention, its cry for personal responsibility and inspiration." --<b>Emma Restall Orr</b>, author of <i>Living With Honour, The Wakeful World</i>, and other books on Druidry and animism<br><br>"Ivan McBeth was a great teacher, guide, and a good friend. His view of the world was magical, visionary and shamanistic. This book is a wonderful gift and legacy to leave us all.

Rauch explores how the system for producing knowledge works in a liberal society, and why it has now become the object of a powerful ideological attack. Moving beyond the First Amendment, he defends the morality, rather than the legality, of an intellectual regime that relies on unfettered and often hurtful criticism. <i>Kindly Inquisitors</i> is a refreshing and vibrant essay, casting a provocative light on the raging debates over political correctness and multiculturalism.<br><br>"Fiercely argued. . . . What sets his study apart is his attempt to situate recent developments in a long-range historical perspective and to defend the system of free intellectual inquiry as a socially productive method of channeling prejudice."&#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>"Like no other, this book restates the core of our freedom and demonstrates how great, and disregarded, the peril to that freedom has become."&#x2014;Joseph Coates, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"The philosophical defense of free speech and free thought that seems to have been forgotten. . . . A powerful argument."&#x2014;Diane Ravitch, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p><b>Jonathan Rauch</b> is a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a contributing editor of the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>National Journal</i>, and the author of six books, including <i>Government&#x2019;s End</i> and <i>Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America.</i>A compelling defense of free speech against its new enemies, who range from the mosques of Iran to the groves of American academe. In place of Justice Holmes's old standard of truth competing in ``the marketplace of ideas,'' Rauch (The Outnation, 1992--not reviewed; contributing editor to National Journal) substitutes a new one: that of ``liberal science.'' Formulated by skeptical epistemologists like Hume and Locke in reaction to the authoritarian regulation of knowledge advocated by Plato, liberal science sorts through the hurly-burly of conflicting claims of truth, marginalizing those that cannot pass scrutiny while accepting that even today's accepted truth may need to be revised tomorrow. But after years of nurturing the spirit of intellectual freedom and the pursuit of knowledge, this principle recently has been shaken, with the defining moment being Western governments' weak-kneed reaction to the 1989 death threat made by the Ayatollah Khomeini against Salman Rushdie. Rauch divides challengers to free speech into three camps: ``fundamentalists,'' who believe truth is obvious and not to be questioned; ``egalitarians,'' who think that the beliefs of all sincere people deserve equal respect; and ``humanitarians,'' who hold that one must never offend. But whether they are Moslems enraged at negative portrayals of Islam, creationists pressing to have their theory taught along with evolution, or minorities imposing university codes against ``hate speech,'' all these groups wish to revive the Inquisition notion that ``people who hold wrong and hurtful opinions should be punished for the good of society.'' Rauch's strength here lies in his relentless insistence that liberal science, though hurtful at times, is the best means of advancing knowledge and avoiding ``herdthink.'' Rauch, Jewish and gay, calls not just for toleration but for ``the hard self-discipline which requires us to live with offense.'' A powerful salvo in the war over political correctness--and a ringing reaffirmation of the principles of free thought as conceived by Locke, John Stuart Mill, and others. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Chapter titles include The Idea of Philosophy; Three Common Temptations; Philosophy as Cultural Criticism; Philosophy as Cultural Conservation; Philosophy and the Labyrinth of Language; Freedom and Self-Determination; and The Search for the Authentic Self. <b> </b> For anyone who wants to engage in philosophical thinking&#x2014;to experience first hand the wonder, the temptations, the critical tools, and the pleasure of it. </p></p><p>Preface <p> Philosophy is disciplined critical reflection (about fundamental ideas) that springs from wonder. In the process of this book we will unpack this definition, attempting to explain as well as illustrate what it means for philosophy to be disciplined, for it to be critical reflection, what fundamental ideas are, and what it means for philosophy to spring from wonder. </p><p> Beginning students very often find philosophy puzzling and more than a little bit peculiar. Here are three quotes from student essays that express some of that peculiarity:</p><p>Philosophy requires an open mind. People who are afraid to ask themselves hard questions seem turned off by it. It makes you think past "the usual answers," and sometimes we don't want to do that. <br><br> Most of the things you learn in college teach you the right answers. Philosophy is not like that&#x2014;it leaves you with many more questions than when you came in&#x2014;and the problem is they are deep, troublesome questions, the kind that continue to bother you long after the course is done. <br><br> It's common enough that we speak in cliches. But I discovered through studying philosophy how often we also think in them and even perceive the world in cliched ways. Philosophy is a way to make us realize this and to help us get beyond it. </p><p> Philosophy is a peculiar enterprise in more than one way. It requires a peculiar sort of person to do it, it has peculiar temptations for those who engage in it, and it requires a difficult kind of balancing between extremes in order to be done well. This peculiarity is what makes philosophy interesting, challenging, and fun. I invite you to try it. </p><p> Chapters One and Two of this book try to explain what philosophy is, who would be interested in doing it, and what some of the common temptations are for those who pursue it. Chapters Three and Four explore the ways in which philosophy is critical of culture and the ways in which it is culturally conservative. Chapter Four also includes examples of three contemporary thinkers who embody both of these aspects of philosophy. Chapter Five explores the problems that we run into with language and the ways philosophers try to identify and avoid these problems. Chapters Six and Seven are discussions of two particular philosophical issues, freedom and human nature/selfhood. Chapter Seven explores the works of several provocative thinkers on these topics. Chapter Eight returns to the general topic of the nature of philosophy and examines why philosophical inquiries often generate more questions than definitive answers. Is this a sign of philosophy's failure or a sign of its success? </p><p> The purpose of this book is not to tell you about philosophy, although you can learn some things about philosophy and philosophers from reading it. Its main purpose is to invite and provoke you to engage in philosophical thinking, to experience firsthand the wonder, the temptations, the critical tools, and the pleasure of it. This is why it is designed in an open-textured way, including dialogues, explanations, discussions, and questions in each of the chapters. The book will be successful if you are provoked to wonder and to reflect critically by the discussions initiated in it. This book does not pretend to offer a complete discussion of any of the topics it raises, but rather should be used as a place for a continuing discussion to begin. The questions that follow each chapter are designed to engage you in such a discussion, which is, after all, what philosophy really is.</p><p> <i>What is philosophy? Who pursues it, and why? Aren't people who study it sort of weird? How is philosophy connected to wonder? How is it connected to being critical? What good does it do? How is it like / unlike psychology or history? What kinds of questions do philosophers pose? Do they ever answer them?<i> </i></i></p><i><i> <p>These are the kinds of questions perplexed students often ask when first encountering philosophy as an academic discipline, and these are the kinds of questions this text takes seriously and attempts to answer. Designed to be a first encounter with philosophy, this text includes:</p> <p> </p><ul> <li>Dialogues that provoke and engage students in philosophical thinking.</li> <li>Discussions that clarify and explain issues and introduce the "discipline" of philosophy.</li> <li>Inquiries pursued with seriousness and a sense of humor.</li> <li>Brief introductions to a variety of thinkers from Socrates and Diogenes the Cynic to Iris Murdoch and Suzi Gablik.</li> <li>Philosophical theorizing about human freedom, the nature of the self, the ends and means of education, the way language shapes thinking, why we often think in clichï¿½s and stereotypes, etc.</li> <li>Questions at the end of each chapter designed to encourage students in critical reflection and writing.</li> </ul></i></i></p><h2>First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1 (First Aid USMLE)</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality,&nbsp;authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The essential case companion to <i>First Aid for theï¿½ USMLE Step 1</i></b></p><p><b><i>400 high-yield cases</i></b></p><p><i>First Aid&#x2122; Cases for the USMLE Step 1</i> features 400 well-illustrated cases to help you relate basic science concepts to clinical situations.

A slaveowner himself, Jeremiah was falsely accused by whites&#x2014;who resented his success as a Charleston harbor pilot&#x2014;of sowing insurrection among slaves at the behest of the British.</p><p>Chief among the accusers was Henry Laurens, Charleston&#x2019;s leading patriot, a slaveowner and former slave trader, who would later become the president of the Continental Congress.

In unraveling the mystery of a slave insurrection plot, Harris provides a wonderfully thick description of colonial life in Charles Town, South Carolina, in 1775. Harris weaves together lives of three slaveowners: wealthy merchant Henry Laurens, son of a British duke William Campbell, and harbor pilot, African American Thomas Jeremiah. This model microhistory opens up wonderful new insights about liberty in the context of the American Revolution: what liberty meant and for whom. This is history at its best, history as it should be.&#x201d;&#x2014;Orville Vernon Burton, author of <i>The Age of Lincoln</i><br><br> (Orville Vernon Burton)<br><br>"This well told tale, brilliantly illustrating the American contradiction, centers on a black slaveholder, dubiously hung for allegedly fomenting a slave revolt at the time of colonial whites' revolt against English 'enslavement.'&nbsp; The book's excruciating dedication reinforces its continued relevance to consistency about human liberty."&#x2014;William W.

I wanted to be sexy, or glamorous!" Jean, 38, laments, "Ilearned the whole job in six weeks, and now I'm bored."<br> <br> Gifted Grownups, Marylou Kelly Streznewski's unprecedented, 10-yearstudy of 100 gifted adults, examines how being identified as a"smart kid" early on affects career choices, friendships, andromantic pairings later in life. Why do some talented and giftedpeople become Mozarts and Einsteins or corporate chieftains, whileothers drop out of school, struggle to hold down jobs, or turn toself-destructive behavior? What are the signs of giftedness, itspitfalls, and its promise? Marylou Streznewski provides answers tothese and other questions, and creates an intriguing picture ofwhat it is like to have an accelerated mind in a slow-movingworld.<br> <br> Traditionally, the gifted were measured in terms of intelligenceonly, and anyone with an IQ score higher than 130 was automaticallygrouped in with that misunderstood minority. Recently "giftedness"has been redefined to include qualities like extraordinarycreative, leadership, or physical skills. Heightened perception,sensitivity, humor, and the ability to put complex ideas togetherquickly are also aspects of giftedness. These gifts affect the waytalented adults react to their friends, families, jobs, and lifechallenges. Doing for gifted grownups what the bestselling Drivento Distraction did for adults with attention deficit, GiftedGrownups traces many types of gifted adults, including thehigh-testing, power-achieving Striver; the popular scholar orathlete Superstar; and the creative intellectual, free-spiritIndependent. Here for the first time and in their own words, 100gifted grownups, from ages 18 to 90, and a variety of family andeducational backgrounds, occupations, social classes, and races,count the blessings and tally the costs of a high-powered mind."Highly informative and interesting."--Alice Miller, author of TheDrama of the Gifted Child<br> <br> "This book was a delight.

Paul Torrance, Georgia Studies of Creative Behavior,author of Gifted and Talented Children in the Regular Classroom.ISBN 0-471-29580-9</p><p>MARYLOU KELLY STREZNEWSKI, MEd, is certified as a Program Specialist in Gifted Education and is a poet and fiction writer. She has taught gifted teenagers for 20 years, and worked with college students and senior citizens. Streznewski resides in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she is at work on her second novel.According to Streznewski, gifted people constitute 3% to 5% of the population, are inquisitive and energetic, have rapid mental processes and a restless drive to enlarge their world. Among the 100 "gifted grownups," ages 18 to 90, interviewed for this unsatisfying study, we meet a Wall Street lawyer, a machinist who writes poetry, a convicted murderer who's working on her autobiography, plus Ph.D.s, office workers, professors, dropouts, scientists and salesmen. Streznewski, who teaches gifted high school students, rather artificially classifies the gifted into three types: "strivers," high-scoring teacher-pleasers who go on to high achievements; "superstars," sociable scholar-athletes or popular personalities on a trajectory to fame and fortune; and "independents," inner-directed, creative intellectuals who challenge authority. Her contention that gifted adults ignore the conventional life stages and follow their own special rhythms, changing jobs and careers in spite of the cost to themselves and loved ones, remains speculative. And her lumping of "intelligent criminals" into the sample, however well-intentioned, stretches her fuzzy definition of giftedness to the breaking point. The author, who considers herself, her husband and their four children gifted, tends to use vapid or slippery statements ("Let's face it, if you are a gifted person, you are, on the great highway of life, something like a Porsche... you have a high-performance engine between your ears"). She dispenses advice targeted to gifted women, gifted senior citizens, corporations, schools and parents in an informal, occasionally edifying canvas that's too superficial to serve as a comprehensive handbook. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gibson's Fabulous Flat-Top Guitars : An Illustrated History &amp; Guide</h2><p>Who can forget the singular sound of the Everly Brothersï¿½ guitar in ï¿½Wake Up Little Susieï¿½ and ï¿½By By Loveï¿½? It was the sound of a Gibson flat top, one of the finest acoustic guitars ever produced. This great American icon is the subject of Gibsonï¿½s Fabulous Flat Tops, a comprehensive book that chronicles the history of the Gibson company and the growth and development of their flat top guitars. It covers every model from 1918 to the present; includes over 100 color photos and 150 b&amp;w ones; includes reminiscences from many of the well-known performers who play flat tops; and much more. 8-1/4 inch. x 11 inch..</p><p>In acoustic guitars, the Gibson brand name is an assurance of high quality. Due to haphazard serial numbering systems and inconsistent application of them, however, the comprehensive history of Gibson guitars that fans have long desired has not been forthcoming until now. Drawing on previous works that examined facets of the Gibson story as well as the authors' own research into primary sources, it is a combination of text and pictures that shows why "only a Gibson is good enough." The authors attempted to examine every Gibson model since the 1920s and succeeded so well that they describe even the Jumbo Deluxe, of which only three were made. They discuss the musical properties of individual models, and they chronicle illustrious owners and players of the various models, interviewing some. Their book would be worth having just for the pictures of the guitars and their owners, but the research, care, and affection that went into it make it more than a coffee-table denizen or nostalgia trove. It is a valuable historical document describing an important aspect of American pop culture. <i>Mike Tribby</i>This volume offers a lavishly illustrated history of the Gibson company and its classic flat-top guitars. The book's release coincides with the company's centennial celebration. From the 1920s to the present, Gibson and its guitars have been a slice of Americana. Whether an established musician is Northern or Southern, urban or rural, white or African American, young or old, he or she has likely used a Gibson to create music. The book employs more than 200 photographs, many in color, and detailed text in chronicling the development and evolution of the instruments. Recommended for public and music libraries. --Eric C.

While some have been coolly distant, even adversarial, others have found their intelligence agencies to be among the most valuable instruments of policy and power.<br><br>Since John F. Kennedy's presidency, this relationship has been distilled into a personalized daily report: a short summary of what the intelligence apparatus considers the most crucial information for the president to know that day about global threats and opportunities. This top-secret document is known as the President's Daily Brief, or, within national security circles, simply "the Book." Presidents have spent anywhere from a few moments (Richard Nixon) to a healthy part of their day (George W. Bush) consumed by its contents; some (Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush) consider it far and away the most important document they saw on a regular basis while commander in chief.<br><br>The details of most PDBs are highly classified, and will remain so for many years. But the process by which the intelligence community develops and presents the Book is a fascinating look into the operation of power at the highest levels. David Priess, a former intelligence officer and daily briefer, has interviewed every living president and vice president as well as more than one hundred others intimately involved with the production and delivery of the president's book of secrets. He offers an unprecedented window into the decision making of every president from Kennedy to Obama, with many character-rich stories revealed here for the first time.</p><p><b>Dr. David Priess</b> served during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations as an award-winning intelligence officer, manager, and daily intelligence briefer at the CIA, as well as a desk officer at the State Department. He obtained his PhD in political science from Duke University and has published articles in journals such as <i>Security Studies, Middle East Policy</i>, and the <i>Mershon International Studies Review</i>, as well as book reviews and eclectic articles in outlets ranging from <i>Foreword</i> to <i>Skeptic</i>. Priess is currently director of analytic services for Analytic Advantage, Inc., offering specialized training, mentoring, and consulting services to the intelligence community, other government offices, and the private sector.<br>"In <em>The President's Book of Secrets</em>, David Priess succeeds in lifting up the curtain on the personalities behind national security and how the government's leading analysts bend to those characters to fulfill their duty."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Charged Affair</em></i></b><br><br>"[Priess] deftly sketches the evolution of this daily intelligence digest, along with the twists and turns of policy, personalities and power plays...Anyone interested in how decisions get made by the most powerful person in the most powerful country in the world will relish the details in <i>The President's Book of Secrets</i>."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Wall Street Journal</em></i></b><br><br>"David Priess, a CIA officer who served as a daily intelligence briefer during the Clinton and George W.

Those insights are an interesting addition to the historical record on U.S. foreign policy."&#x2015;<b><i><strong>Jack Caravelli</strong>, <em>The Washington Free Beacon</em></i></b><br><br>"An important addition to the body of academic works on national security. It offers a unique look into the people and processes that impacted and continue to shape the course of history. In lifting the veil, Priess gives readers not just a close look at a key product that influences the choices of those in the White House, but the inner workings of government itself."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Proceedings</em></i></b><br><br>"An authoritative yet easily read book about an important part of the president's daily routine. [Priess] has successfully enlivened the work with myriad first-person accounts from former presidents down to the folks who have written the PDB articles. A CIA review of the manuscript ensured that classified material was not included, but Priess gives the reader plenty of substance to go with details of the process. As a result, <i>The President's Book of Secrets</i> offers a previously untold story about one of those closely guarded, 'eyes-only' facets of the intelligence world."&#x2015;<b><i><strong>Michael K. Bohn</strong>, <em>Tribune News Service</em></i></b><br><br>"A welcome change of pace from the traditional spy yarn or tell-all books that dominate the intelligence literature today. Priess' work makes an invaluable contribution to the study of intelligence, which no library on national security is complete without...Priess's prose is highly readable, fast paced, more interesting and even suspenseful than many readers might expect when given a story about analysts doing their work. Priess is an exceptional raconteur, and his style makes characters come alive on the page."&#x2015;<b><i><em>The Cipher Brief</em></i></b><br><br>"At times as entertaining as it is informative, Priess' book is neither a dry academic exercise nor a sensational tell-all expose, but is instead a thoughtful and revealing peek behind the scenes of what goes on between the President and the keepers of the nation's secrets."&#x2015;<b><i><strong>Mark McLaughlin</strong>, <em>DC Examiner</em></i></b><br><br>"This volume provides greater understanding of how presidents' minds operate and dissect information. It also humanizes their decisions by detailing the intricacies of how the PDB is handled. With the September 2015 release of the Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson PDBs, this publication is timely...Recommended for those interested in a different perspective on the U.S. presidency, political scientists, and historians."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Library Journal</em>, starred review</i></b><br><br>"Turns the potentially dour history of the president's daily intelligence briefing into a stimulating, if uncritical, account...

Julia Donaldson</h2><p>Bestselling sequel to the smash-hit picture book, The Gruffalo One dark night the Gruffalo&#39;s child disobeys her father&#39;s warnings and ventures out into the snow. After all, the Big Bad Mouse doesn&#39;t really exist . . . does he? The Gruffalo&#39;s Child is the much-loved sequel to Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler&#39;s bestselling phenomenon, The Gruffalo.</p><p>Julia Donaldson is the outrageously talented, prize-winning author of the world&#39;s best-loved picture books, and was the 2011-2013 UK Children&#39;s Laureate. Her books include Room on the Broom, What the Ladybird Heard and the modern classic The Gruffalo, which has sold over 13.5 million copies worldwide and has been translated into over sixty languages. Julia also writes fiction as well as poems, plays and songs and her brilliant live children&#39;s shows are always in demand. Julia and her husband Malcolm divide their time between Sussex and Edinburgh. Axel Scheffler is a star illustrator whose instantly recognisable, warm and witty illustrations have achieved worldwide acclaim and numerous awards. In addition to his picture books, Axel is the illustrator of wonderful novelty and gift books for Macmillan, such as the bestselling The Bedtime Bear, The Tickle Book and Mother Goose&#39;s Nursery Rhymes. He also illustrates the popular Pip and Posy series. Born in Hamburg, Axel now lives with his family in London.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;In this sequel to <i>The Gruffalo</i> (Dial, 1999), the wide-eyed daughter of that story's title character decides to find the "Big Bad Mouse" that her father has told her so much about. "His eyes are like pools of terrible fire,/and his terrible whiskers are tougher than wire." With her stick doll tucked under her arm, the youngster enters the deep, dark woods and follows marks in the snow to snake, owl, and fox. When she finally finds a little mouse, she grabs him for a feast, but the clever creature tricks her into running away to the comfort of her sleeping father's arms. The full-color cartoons portray a suitably sympathetic child in the snow-filled woods. While children may appreciate the details (the stick doll, snake tracks in the snow, gruffalo child's cave drawings) in the art, lack of change from picture to picture and in perspective diminish its effectiveness. The plot, rhymes, and art are all slightly weaker than the original tale.

Two tapes had<br>previously been made by the same bi-dialectal African American<br>speaker, one in African American language (as distinguished by vocabulary,<br>syntax, and pronunciation)and one in American Standard<br>English. A tape player with one of the tapes was put into each box,<br>out of the children&#x2019;s view. Each box was described as a head&#x201d; and<br>each relayed the same messages. The voice in each box introduced<br>itself to the children and indicated that it had a present for the child.<br>Later, each box also asked the children if they would give the<br>speaker their crayons. The children were then asked a number of<br>questions, including these: Which head,&#x201d; Steve [Standard English]<br>or Kenneth [Black English], would you like to get the present<br>from? Whom do you like better? Whom would you like to play<br>with? Whom would you give your crayons to?<br> <br>Over 70 percent of the time, both African American and European<br>American three- to five-year-olds categorized the BE speaker<br>as African American and the SE speaker as white. Further, most<br>of them wanted the present from the SE speaker because he had<br>nicer presents.&#x201d; The majority of the children of both ethnicities<br>believed that the BE speaker, Kenneth, needed&#x201d; the crayons more,<br>with one European American boy, aged five and a half, saying that<br>he would give his crayons to Kenneth cause he don&#x2019;t have nothing&#x201d;<br>and one four-year-old European American girl indicating that<br>she was afraid of Kenneth (Rosenthal, p.62).<br> <br>The findings are fascinating. They indicate, according to the<br>researcher, that very young children have developed attitudes toward<br>African American language and assumptions about its speakers<br>that closely parallel adult American views:<br> <br>Interestingly, the African American and white children reflected<br>differences in their personal preferences towards the<br>representative speakers of the two language forms, with the<br>white children preferring the SE speaker and the African<br>American children preferring the BE speaker. Furthermore,<br>there were expressions of learned stereotyped images associated<br>with both speakers. Many of these were pejorative toward<br>the BE speaker identifying him as talking silly, being<br>unintelligible, being harmful, having nothing, and not having<br>drawing ability. . . . The SE speaker was stereotyped as being<br>more gentle, looking better, having better drawing ability,<br>and being the symbol of success (the last idea was expressed<br>by Population B [African American]).<br> <br>It should not be surprising that these attitudes carry over into<br>school. In another study done in the 1970s, student teachers were<br>asked to assess eight hypothetical schoolchildren on the scales of<br>intelligence, being a good student, being privileged, enthusiastic,<br>self-confident, and gentle [Giles &amp; Powesland, 1975:3, cited in R. A.<br>Hudson, Sociolinguistics, Cambridge University Press, 1980]. The<br>eight hypothetical students were each defined by three types of<br>information: a photograph, a tape-recorded sample of speech, and<br>a sample of school work (consisting of an essay and a drawing).<br>Each piece of information was based on a real child, but the pieces<br>were recombined to give equal numbers of occasions in which each<br>type of information would be judged positively and negatively.<br>Hudson (1980)describes the study results:<br> <br>The question to be answered by this experiment was: what<br>would happen if information from one source gave a favourable<br>impression but that from another source gave an unfavourable<br>one? The very clear answer was that information<br>from the speech sample always [emphasis added] took priority<br>over that from the photograph or the school-work: a favourable<br>impression on the speech sample overrode unfavourable<br>impressions from the other sources, and conversely. (p. 208)<br> <br>As Michael Stubbs contends (in chapter 5), if school considers<br>someone&#x2019;s language inadequate, they&#x2019;ll probably fail.<br> <br>Our language embraces us long before we are defined by any other<br>medium of identity. In our mother&#x2019;s womb we hear and feel the<br>sounds, the rhythms, the cadences of our mother tongue.&#x201d; We<br>learn to associate contentment with certain qualities of voice and<br>physical disequilibrium with others. Our home language is as viscerally<br>tied to our beings as existence itself as the sweet sounds<br>of love accompany our first milk, as our father&#x2019;s pride permeates<br>our bones and flesh when he shows us off to his friends, as a gentle<br>lullaby or soft murmurs signal release into restful sleep. It is no<br>wonder that our first language becomes intimately connected to<br>our identity.<br> <br>Just as our skin provides us with a means to negotiate our interactions<br>with the world both in how we perceive our surroundings<br>and in how those around us perceive us our language plays<br>an equally pivotal role in determining who we are: it is <i>The Skin<br>That We Speak.</i> <br> <br>For better or worse, in our stratified society our appearance can<br>serve to create an expectation of success or failure, of brilliance or<br>stupidity, of power or impotence.

Victoria Purcell-Gates sums it up in<br>the title of her chapter, . . . As Soon As She Opened Her Mouth!&#x201d;<br> <br>The purpose of this 2002 collection is to explore the links between<br>language and identity, between language and political hierarchy,<br>and between language and cultural conflict.<br> <br>Most of the articles in this collection make reference to African<br>American language (also called Black English, Ebonics, or African<br>American Vernacular English), which is, without question, one of<br>the most vigorously debated linguistic codes in our nation&#x2019;s history.<br>As early as 1884, J. Harrison attempted to detail in a fifty-sevenpage<br>treatise that the language of Negroes&#x201d; was an oddity that<br>only vaguely resembled language at all.<br> <br>This volume also concerns itself primarily with language and<br>education. This issue of language use in school is particularly volatile.<br>The commencement of formal education is usually one of<br>the first settings in a person&#x2019;s life when their language may be<br>judged as right or wrong; when assumptions may be made about<br>their intelligence, family life, future potential, or moral fiber every<br>time a sentence is uttered. African American language has had a<br>particularly stormy relationship with the educational power structure.<br>Schools often see themselves, and are seen by the larger society,<br>as the arbiters of what is proper, correct, and decent. African<br>American language forms have been considered none of the above.<br>Thus, there have been continual moves to eliminate its presence<br>in classrooms, and raging debates whenever it appears that there<br>might be some move to suggest otherwise.<br> <br>The most recent flare-up, the so-called Ebonics Debate,&#x201d; took<br>the country by storm during 1996 and 1997. The Oakland School<br>District put forth a proposal that named the language form spoken<br>by many of its African American students Ebonics.&#x201d; It not only<br>provided a moniker, but the proposal also declared Ebonics a distinct<br>language, not a dialect or substandard form of English. Further,<br>it recommended that teachers be trained in the elements of<br>Ebonics and steeped in aspects of African American culture. Such<br>training, they argued, would enable teachers to create instruction<br>for African American students that would allow them not only to<br>excel in learning standard English, but to excel in all school subjects.<br>This result had already been achieved on a small scale using<br>the program the board advocated, the Standard English Proficiency<br>Program.&#x201d; Despite the school board&#x2019;s good intentions, the<br>country went on a rampage, with reporter after reporter declaring<br>that Oakland was planning to teach Black slang and ghetto language<br>to its schoolchildren. Several of the essays in this volume<br>refer to the debate, and more details of the battle are described in<br>chapter 3, No Kinda Sense. Also included, as an appendix, is the<br>formal response of the Linguistic Society of America on the Oakland<br>Ebonics debate.<br> <br>However, this was not the first time African American language<br>and the education establishment engaged in a very awkward, painful,<br>and public dance. After the riots of the 1960s the general public<br>became aware that African American children were failing in<br>schools in large numbers. African American leaders and, later, President<br>Johnson&#x2019;s War on Poverty&#x201d; demanded solutions. Educational<br>scholars, casting about for blame, speculated about the cause<br>of the problem and hit upon the idea that the children&#x2019;s inferior<br>language was the cause of their learning problem. With little or<br>no empirical research to back the claims, what amounted to rumors<br>were circulated through articles, essays, and speeches indicating<br>that African American children had a miniscule vocabulary, were<br>nonverbal, had no substantive communicative exchanges with their<br>parents, and were crushed by the noise and confusion in their<br>homes. The Head Start Program, in large part, was initiated to<br>mitigate the culturally and linguistically deprived&#x201d; homes of poor<br>African American children.<br> <br>Linguists, mostly white, began to study the question. The<br>language was mapped and its unique grammatical features, phonology,<br>and semantics were identified. In contrast to the educators,<br>most linguists concluded that there was nothing inherently inferior<br>about the language of African Americans, but that problems might<br>arise when the language of school and the language of home met.<br>Some African American scholars began to take issue with the work<br>of the white linguists, suggesting that, at best, they were unable<br>to really understand Black language because the language did not<br>exist apart from the culture and they had insufficient access to the<br>culture. It was during this period that the term Ebonics&#x201d; (black<br> phonics, i.e., black sounds)was coined by Professor Robert Williams<br>in the early 1970s, when he convened a meeting of African<br>American scholars to study the question from a culturally specific<br>perspective. He proposed that the white linguists were wrong to<br>consider African American language to be a dialect of English,<br>since the linguistic code really had its roots in West African languages.<br>As the controversy continued, accusations of opportunism,<br>self-aggrandizement, and being in league with the government&#x2019;s<br>attempts to keep African Americans disenfranchised eventually led<br>many white linguists to seek other areas of study (Shuy in Farr-<br>Whiteman).<br> <br>The next major public explosion concerning African American<br>language and the schools was in 1979, when, in what came to be<br>known as the <i>King</i> case,&#x201d; parents from the Green Road Housing<br>Project in Detroit sued the school system for not educating their<br>children, specifically for failing to teach them to read. The judge<br>in the case, Judge Joiner, eventually dismissed all of the plaintiffs&#x2019;<br>claims except one, forcing the lawsuit to be tried only on 1703(f),<br>which reads in part: No state shall deny equal educational opportunity<br>to an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex,<br>or national origin, by . . . the failure to overcome language barriers<br>that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional<br>programs.&#x201d;<br> <br>The judge eventually ruled in the plaintiffs&#x2019; favor, and declared<br>that the teachers and the school system had not taken into account<br>the children&#x2019;s language in their instruction, and thus had failed to<br>teach them appropriately. He ruled that the school board had not<br>previously, but now should (1) help the teachers understand the<br>problem&#x201d;; (2) help provide them with knowledge about the children&#x2019;s<br>use of a black English&#x2019; language system&#x201d;; and (3) suggest<br>ways and means of using that knowledge in teaching the students<br>to read.&#x201d; The plaintiffs&#x2019; lawyers did not think the solution, without<br>any accountability or classroom intervention, went far enough. The<br>public, however, went wild. The media once more peppered the<br>airways and newspapers with suggestions that the judge was equating<br>Black slang and improper English with a true language.<br> <br>In the Ebonics debate of 1996, in the War on Poverty reports<br>and counter reports of the 1960s and early 1970s, and in the furor<br>surrounding the <i>King</i> case in the early 1980s, the public discussions<br>and publicized scholarly research ended rather suddenly, and with<br>no resolution. Still today African American children fail, and still<br>there is much smoke and little light around the linguistic issues<br>that might affect that failure. Two major professional organizations<br>of English educators have been discussing the educational costs of<br>language discrimination for more than twenty-five years, passing<br> <i>Students&#x2019; Right to Their Own Language</i> in 1974 and the National<br>Language Policy in 1988. A survey taken in 2000 by the NCTE &amp;<br>CCCC, however, showed that fully one-third of the membership<br>had no knowledge of the positions the organizations had taken.<br> <br>During each of the peaks of public interest in African American<br>language and education, scholars have pointed out, but with little<br>public attention, that it may not be the children&#x2019;s language that<br>causes educational problems, but the educational bureaucracy&#x2019;s response<br>to the language. These scholars looked more to attitudes<br>held about the language. They posited that the country&#x2019;s perception<br>of African Americans was such that, given the history of racism in<br>the United States, it attached inferiority to all things black.<br></p><h2>Precalculus, Books a la Carte Edition (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>This edition features the exact same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.

Yet something about our species separated it from the pack, and led to its survival while the rest became extinct. So just what was it that allowed <i>Homo sapiens</i> to become Masters of the Planet? Curator Emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, Ian Tattersall takes us deep into the fossil record to uncover what made humans so special. Surveying a vast field from initial bipedality to language and intelligence, Tattersall argues that <i>Homo sapiens</i> acquired a winning combination of traits that was not the result of long term evolutionary refinement. Instead it emerged quickly, shocking their world and changing it forever.</p></p><p><p><b>Ian Tattersall, PhD</b> is a curator in the Division of Anthropology of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where he co-curates the Spitzer Hall of Human Origins.

But Ian Tattersall introduces us to several different human-like precursors, all alive at the same time, as recently as 50,000 years ago - just barely before the period we humans chauvinistically refer to as 'history'. So it's no longer straightforward: beasts like us emerged several times within the past hundred thousand years, some of them distinct species. Some were the first to think like we do: in symbols and abstractions; those were our forebears. But while they were alive, these multiple different humanoids may have known about each other; interacted; fought; lived together or apart; possibly even bred. It turns out that our lineage is anything but linear; Tattersall demolishes the versions we were once taught, and lays out the remarkable new history of our diverse origins for the first time.&#x201d; &#x2015;Richard Granger, author of Big Brain</p><p>&#x201c;Are you ready for a 3.5 billion year stroll down the path of life's origins to the present.

This textbook stresses common techniques (such as generating functions and recursive construction) that underlie the great variety of subject matter, and the fact that a constructive or algorithmic proof is more valuable than an existence proof. The author emphasizes techniques as well as topics and includes many algorithms described in simple terms. The text should provide essential background for students in all parts of discrete mathematics.</p><p>Including many algorithms described in simple terms, this textbook stresses common techniques (such as generating functions and recursive construction) that underlie the great variety of subject matter, and the fact that a constructive or algorithmic proof is more valuable than an existence proof.Combinatorics is a subject of increasing importance, owing to its links with computer science, statistics and algebra. This is a textbook aimed at second-year undergraduates to beginning graduates. It stresses common techniques (such as generating functions and recursive construction) which underlie the great variety of subject matter and also stresses the fact that a constructive or algorithmic proof is more valuable than an existence proof. The book is divided into two parts, the second at a higher level and with a wider range than the first. Historical notes are included which give a wider perspective on the subject. More advanced topics are given as projects and there are a number of exercises, some with solutions given.</p><h2>International Law: Evolving Doctrine and Practice (University Casebook Series)</h2><p><i>International Law: Evolving Doctrine and Practice</i> offers a flexible arrangement of materials for the teaching of an introductory course in international law. The inspiration for the book&#x2019;s editorial approach is the recognition that each professor comes to the study of international law from a variety of normative, critical, or interdisciplinary perspectives, and that the materials should be flexible enough to accommodate all comers. With this goal of pedagogical ecumenism in mind, the chapters present a variety of critical approaches to international law without letting one particular view dominate, though taken together the materials highlight the evolving nature of international legal doctrine and those areas where its legal norms remain contested or controversial. Sprinkled through each chapter are short Problem Cases&#x2015;less than a page in length&#x2015;that give students the opportunity to apply the doctrine to a unique fact pattern. The Problem Cases are presented in modular text boxes that can form the basis for rich classroom discussions or simply reserved for background reading at home, whichever the professor wishes. In addition to the typical array of chapters on sources and subjects of international law, human rights, International Humanitarian Law, International Criminal Law, the use of force, and humanitarian intervention, the book also includes chapters on international economic law and environmental law, including a consideration of the challenge posed by climate change.</p><p></p><h2>Medieval History For Dummies</h2><p>Is your knowledge of The Crusades less than tip-top?

Written by a former paramedic with a PhD in alternative healthcare, this in-depth reference shows that the subtle shifts in awareness commonly observed in cannabis-using patients vastly contribute to these compounds' therapeutic potential. <br><br> <i>The Cannabis Health Index</i> is organized into condition-specific chapters, with eye-catching ratings of cannabis efficacy for each symptom, along with recommendations for use, and sidebars that suggest related mindfulness-based practices that enhance the body's own ability to heal. Organized alphabetically from aging to wound care, with sections on a variety of conditions including infections, cancer, cardiovascular health, eye diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurological diseases, and much more, the Index reveals that the huge body of scientific studies focused on cannabis is a tremendously under-utilized repository of knowledge. <br><br> In synthesizing the findings of these studies, Blesching brings clarity to the process of making informed decisions about cannabis as a valid treatment. Informative, user-friendly, and practical, The <i>Cannabis Health Index</i> presents striking evidence that cannabis is remarkable safe and effective when used within the proper therapeutic window, especially compared with the risks of managing chronic symptoms with pharmaceuticals.</p><p>UWE BLESCHING, is a medical journalist and regular contributor to the cannabinoid health sciences, mind-body medicine, phytopharmacology, as well as evidence-based illness prevention and treatment protocols.

It reinforced expectations for Christmas Day as a time of peace and goodwill to all men&#x201d;and it even put turkey on the menu as the staple meal for many in the Western world. This special facsimile of the original 1843 edition reproduces the book just as the first avid readers of A Christmas Carol would have experienced it. Presented in an eye-catching slipcase, the book contains original, magical designs by John Leech that were commissioned by Dickens himself for the first edition.</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Out of the Shadows: Understanding Sexual Addiction</h2><p>This book is the first work ever published on sexual addiction, examines the tangled web of love, addictive sex, hate and fear often found in family relationships.

Such features are central to any attempt at the theoretical definition of human society and such constituent phenomena as religious and legal systems, and in this study Professor Goody explores the role of a specific mechanism, the introduction of writing and the development of a written tradition, in the explanation of some important social differences and similarities. Goody argues that a shift of emphasis from productive to certain communicative processes is essential to account adequately for major changes in human societies. Whilst there have been previous descussions of the effect of literacy upon social organisation, no study has hitherto presented the general synthesis developed here.</p><p>Jack Goody is Emeritus Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of St John&#39;s College.

At thirty-three, he was the youngest chef ever to be awarded three Michelin stars; and in 2005 he became the first chef in the world to win three stars for three restaurants, with a staggering total of fourteen stars spread across eight restaurants in three countries. He has mentored a generation of younger chefs who have introduced his cooking around the world and he has, quite simply, changed the face of traditional French cooking. <br><br> In this, his first American cookbook, M. Ducasse shares the principles and techniques of his uniquely elemental cuisine. At its core are clarity of taste, precision in execution, and respect for the food itself, which to Ducasse means retaining its essential flavor. That respect for true taste results in a multitude of simple but striking techniques. Ducasse uses as much of each ingredient as he can&#x2014;the skins, the shells, the baking juices, the pan drippings, the heads, the cooking broth, all the by-products of the process&#x2014;in order to capture the truest taste. He incorporates different preparations of the same ingredient into a given dish, each revealing an individual aspect of its flavor&#x2014;sliced raw artichokes, braised whole artichokes, and paper-thin slices of fried artichoke, for example, might be featured together. The brilliance of his food&#x2014;apparent in recipes made with no more than two ingredients enhanced by a simple aromatic element, with seasoning reduced to a few grains of salt&#x2014;explains why he is "the country's star chef" (<i>Wine Spectator</i>) and "the Escoffier of our time" (<i>Le Point</i>).<br><br><i>Ducasse Flavors of France</i> documents, in more than one hundred lavishly photographed recipes, the influences&#x2014;Mediterranean, Provenï¿½al, and classical French&#x2014;that permeate this extaordinary cuisine. Many of the recipes are simple, others complex, but all can be perfectly accomplished with a little time and patience.With its "alluringly simple dishes, like buttery fork-mashed potatoes, peppered slices of sauteed pumpkin, swordfish with citrus, exquisite chocolate tartlets, and a homey pear and honey cake made with big chunks of pear" (<i>The New York Times</i>), this is the most accessible Ducasse cookbook published. Yet there are still recipes to challenge ambitious cooks and great tips that will make all cooks better in the kitchen.</p><p><i>Ducasse</i> is a book you'll want to leave out on a coffee table. It is more than beautiful--left open, it has the power to transform the nature of a room with its exquisite photographs and recipes, which are as good to read as they are to cook from. Taken into the kitchen, the power is inherent in <i>Ducasse</i> to transform any meal well beyond the exemplary. But then there's the danger that a spill or greasy fingers might soil the pages, which would be tragic. And yet, this is not just another pretty book, something to thumb through and shrug off. This is a book to take to heart, starting with the first recipe--Fennel "Marmalade"--and then on to Cocotte of Young Spring Vegetables, Spiny Lobster with a Rhubarb-Ginger Chardonnay Sauce, and Chicken Fricassee with Morels, and so on, and so on, until you end up with Coffee and Chocolate Parfait with Dark Chocolate Sauce. Alain Ducasse is the only chef with six Michelin stars to his credit. In his kitchens and in his book he uses the best possible ingredients, treating each and every one with deserved respect. Recipes have been tried and tested to ensure perfection, and--reassuringly--dishes work well in the home kitchen. Ducasse is a wonderful teacher, and every page is filled with rich descriptions of flavor, color, texture, and aroma. Like so much about Alain Ducasse, it is a picture of food that defies language. You will recognize it, though, turning these gorgeous pages, plotting the next dish you choose to master. The opportunity exists with <i>Ducasse</i> to gain a new kind of fluency. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i>Brash, driven, and dazzlingly inventive, Alain Ducasse was the youngest chef ever to be awarded three Michelin stars, and in 1998, he became the first chef in over sixty years to earn three stars in two restaurants simultaneously.

Since the first edition of this volume was published, much has changed globally, directly impacting the phenomenon of human smuggling. Migrant smuggling and human trafficking are now more entrenched than ever in many regions, with efforts to combat them both largely unsuccessful and often counterproductive. This book explores human smuggling in several forms and regions, globally examining its deep historic, social, economic, and cultural roots and its broad political consequences.</p><p>Contributors to the updated and expanded edition consider the trends and events of the past several years, especially in light of developments after 9/11 and the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. They also reflect on the moral economy of human smuggling and trafficking, the increasing percentage of the world's asylum seekers who escape political violence only by being smuggled, and the implications of human smuggling in a warming world.</p></p><p>Contributors: Peter Andreas, Reed College ï¿½ Ko-Lin Chin, Rutgers University, Newark ï¿½ John Dale, University of California, Davis ï¿½ Nora Demleitner, St. Mary&#39;s University ï¿½ James O.

This book teaches how these architectures operate using clear, comprehensible examples to explain the concepts, and provides a good reference for people already familiar with the basic concepts.</p><p><p>The goal of this book is to provide practical information on the issues operating systems must address in order to run on modern computer systems that employ cache memories and/or multiprocessors. At the time of this writing, a number of books describe UNIX system implementations, but none describes in detail how caches and multiprocessors should be managed. Many computer architecture books describe caches and multiprocessors from the hardware aspect, but none successfully deals with the operating system issues that these modern architectures present. This book is intended to fill these gaps by bridging computer architecture and operating systems.</p><p>Written with the operating developer in mind, this book explains the operation of caches and multiprocessors from the system programmers point of view. While targeted toward UNIX system programmers, the book has been written so that the information can be applied to any operating system, including all UNIX variations. This is accomplished by explaining the issues and solutions at a conceptual level and using the UNIX system services as examples of where the issues will be encountered. The solutions can then be applied to other operating systems in the corresponding situations.</p><p>This book is intended to assist the operating system developer in two ways. First, the reader will learn how existing operating systems must be adapted to run on modern architectures. This is accomplished by a detailed examination of the operation of these architectures from the operating system perspective and an explanation of what the operating system must do to manage them. Second, the reader will learn the trade-offs involved in the different approaches taken by modern architectures. This will give the operating system developer the background needed when involved in the design of new computer systems employing caches and multiprocessors.</p><p>The reader is assumed to be familiar with the UNIX system call interface and the high-level concepts of UNIX kernel internals. The reader should also be familiar with computer architecture and computer system organization as would be taught in an undergraduate-level computer science course.</p><p>This book is an extension of a course I developed for UNIX system professionals in the computer industry. The course has been taught during the past four years in the United States at USENIX conferences, and in Europe at the EurOpen and UKUUG conferences. The course is a one-day tutorial and as such is limited in the amount of material that can be covered. This book covers all the course material on cache memories and multiprocessors in greater detail and includes additional topics.</p><p>This book is suitable for use in an upper-division undergraduate-level course or at the graduate level. Each chapter concludes with a list of exercises. The questions were chosen so that they could be solved with the information provided in the chapter plus some additional thought, rather than simply parrot the material. In many cases, the exercises build upon the examples presented in the chapter. Answers are generally expected to take the form of a short paragraph (four to five sentences in most cases, sometimes longer). The reader is urged to try all the questions in order to reinforce the concepts learned. Answers to selected exercises are provided in the back of the book.</p><p>We begin with a review of the UNIX system internals that are relevant to the discussion in the remainder of the book. The purpose of the review is to reinforce the concepts of the UNIX operating system and to define terminology used later. The book is then divided into three main parts: cache memory systems, multiprocessor UNIX implementations, and multiprocessor cache consistency. The first part, cache memory systems, introduces cache architecture, terminology, and concepts. It then proceeds to take a detailed look at four common cache implementations: three variations of the virtual cache and then the physical cache. The second part, multiprocessor UNIX implementations, looks at the problems and design issues faced when adapting a uniprocessor kernel implementation to run on a tightly coupled, shared memory multiprocessor. Several different implementations are examined. The final part, multiprocessor cache consistency, combines the concepts of the first two parts by examining the operating system and cache architecture issues that occur when caches are added to a tightly coupled, shared memory multiprocessor system.</p><p>A selected set of modern microprocessor architectures is used to illustrate the concepts where appropriate. Representing the traditional CISC (complex instruction set computer) processors are the Motorola 68040 and the Intel 80X86 line (80386, 80486, and Pentium). The RISC (reduced instruction set computer) approach is represented by the MIPS line (R2000, R3000, and R4000), the Motorola 88000, and the SPARC version 8 compatible processors from Texas Instruments (the MicroSPARC and the SuperSPARC). Several other examples, including Sun and Apollo workstations and the Intel i860, are also presented. A summary of the characteristics of these processors can be found in Appendix A.</p><p>I owe my gratitude to the people who offered their time to review the manuscript before publication.

Symmetric multiprocessing and cache memory systems are important cost-effective technologies for improving performance in today's state-of-the-art systems.</p><p> Written for the UNIX kernel developer, this book provides a complete yet comprehensible explanation of the operation of caches and symmetric multiprocessors, how they work together, and the issues operating systems must address in order to run on the machines that incorporate them.</p><p> After a review of UNIX kernel internals, Curt Schimmel launches into a detailed description of cache memory systems, including several kinds of virtual and physical caches, as well as a chapter on efficient cache management. For each type of cache, the book covers the impact on the software and the operating system changes necessary for these systems. The next section details the operation of the tightly-coupled, shared memory, symmetric multiprocessor. It examines the problems these multiprocessors present to the operating system, such as race conditions, deadlocks, and the ordering of memory operations, and looks at how the UNIX kernel can be adapted to run on such systems. Finally, the book looks at the interaction between cache memory systems and multiprocessors and the new problems that this interaction presents to the kernel. Techniques for solving these problems are then explained. </p><p> Numerous examples representing CISC and RISC processors, such as the Intel 80486 and Pentium, the Motorola 68040 and 88000, as well as theMIPS and SPARC processors, illustrate the concepts presented.

Adopted by William Morris and Burne-Jones "as a pattern for life," the protagonist, Guy, was a popular role model of noble virtue, while another character, Amy, was seen as the ideal Victorian wife--redeemer and inspirer, supporter and guide. This novel is a virtual paradigm of the trends of thought which marked the middle decades of the nineteenth-century. It is also deeply marked by the influence of the Oxford Movement, an aspect explored in Barbara Dennis's Introduction to this unique critical edition.</p><p>First published in 1853, The Heir of Redclyffe was among the most successful novels of the century, equalling even the work of Dickens and Thackeray in popularity. The story of a clash of personality between well-born cousins, Guy Morville and Philip Edmonstone, the plot focuses on Guy&#39;s spiritual struggle to overcome the darker side of his nature. Philip&#39;s sinister insinuations about Guy&#39;s character almost thwart Guy&#39;s marriage to the gentle Amy, yet despite their bitter feuding the novel reaches an unexpected and dramatic conclusion that vindicates romantic virtue, self-sacrifice, and piety, epitomizing the period&#39;s nostalgia for an idealized chivalric past. Adopted by William Morris and Burne-Jones as &#39;a pattern for actual life&#39;, Guy was a popular role model of noble virtue, while Amy is the ideal Victorian wife - redeemer and inspirer, support and guide. The Heir of Redclyffe is a virtual paradigm of the trends of thought which characterized the middle decades of the nineteenth century. It is deeply marked by the influence of the Oxford Movement, an aspect explored by Barbara Dennis in her Introduction to this unique critical edition.Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823 - 1901) was an English novelist known for her huge output. Yonge was born into a religious family background, was devoted to the High Church and much influenced by John Keble, Vicar of Hursley from 1835, a near neighbor and one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Yonge is herself sometimes referred to as &#34;the novelist of the Oxford Movement&#34;, as her novels frequently reflect the values and concerns of Anglo-Catholicism. She remained in Otterbourne all her life and for 71 years was a teacher in the village Sunday school.</p><h2>Anatomy of Malice: The Enigma of the Nazi War Criminals</h2><p><b>In this gripping and haunting narrative, a renowned psychiatrist sheds new light on the psychology of the war criminals at Nuremberg</b><br><br>When the ashes had settled after World War II and the Allies convened an international war crimes trial in Nuremberg, a psychiatrist, Douglas Kelley, and a psychologist, Gustave Gilbert, tried to fathom the psychology of the Nazi leaders, using extensive psychiatric interviews, IQ tests, and Rorschach inkblot tests. Never before or since has there been such a detailed study of governmental leaders who orchestrated mass killings.<br><br> Before the war crimes trial began, it was self-evident to most people that the Nazi leaders were demonic maniacs. But when the interviews and psychological tests were completed, the answer was no longer so clear. The findings were so disconcerting that portions of the data were hidden away for decades and the research became a topic for vituperative disputes. Gilbert thought that the war criminals&#x2019; malice stemmed from depraved psychopathology. Kelley viewed them as morally flawed, ordinary men who were creatures of their environment. Who was right?<br><br> Drawing on his decades of experience as a psychiatrist and the dramatic advances within psychiatry, psychology, and neuroscience since Nuremberg, Joel E. Dimsdale looks anew at the findings and examines in detail four of the war criminals, Robert Ley, Hermann Gï¿½ring, Julius Streicher, and Rudolf Hess. Using increasingly precise diagnostic tools, he discovers a remarkably broad spectrum of pathology.&nbsp;<i>Anatomy of Malice</i>&nbsp;takes us on a complex and troubling quest to make sense of the most extreme evil.</p><p>An eminent psychiatrist offers an eye-opening study of the psychology of evil based on the extensive psychological testing done on high-level Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg Trials.<br><b>Joel E.

Until the early nineteenth century, African slaves came to the Americas in greater numbers than Europeans. <i>In the Shadow of Slavery </i> provides a startling new assessment of the Atlantic slave trade and upends conventional wisdom by shifting attention from the crops slaves were forced to produce to the foods they planted for their own nourishment. Many familiar foods&#x2015;millet, sorghum, coffee, okra, watermelon, and the &#x201c;Asian&#x201d; long bean, for example&#x2015;are native to Africa, while commercial products such as Coca Cola, Worcestershire Sauce, and Palmolive Soap rely on African plants that were brought to the Americas on slave ships as provisions, medicines, cordage, and bedding. In this exciting, original, and groundbreaking book, Judith A. Carney and Richard Nicholas Rosomoff draw on archaeological records, oral histories, and the accounts of slave ship captains to show how slaves' food plots&#x2015;&#x201c;botanical gardens of the dispossessed&#x201d;&#x2015;became the incubators of African survival in the Americas and Africanized the foodways of plantation societies.</p><p>"This book offers something truly new and profound about the Black Atlantic: a glimpse of the presence of African foods, plants, and bodies of everyday knowledge that define Africa's subtle but persistent presence in the Atlantic World and beyond.

No one can connect these diverse topics more effectively than Judith Carney. Building on her pioneering study, <i>Black Rice</i>, Carney's absorbing new book&#x2015;coauthored with Richard Nicholas Rosomoff&#x2015;is original, wide-ranging, and provocative. Like a bountiful African gourd vine, this remarkable overview spreads in many directions and bears impressive fruit.&#x201d;&#x2015;Peter H. Wood, author of <i>Strange New Land: Africans in Colonial America</i><br><br>"In this highly original study, Judith Carney deliberately bypasses the huge (and hugely cruel) investment of slave labor power in the direct production of planter wealth. She offers in its place the less familiar chronicle of slave subsistence, and uncovers the essential role that African agricultural history had played in establishing and sustaining it. <i>In the Shadow of Slavery</i> goes back to Mother Africa, to shed new light on the Old World's part in the building of the New."&#x2015;Sidney W.

Zimmerer, editor of <i>Globalization and New Geographies of Conservation</i><br><br>"A fresh look at the African diaspora's far-reaching consequences by examining its effects on subsistence foods on both sides of the Atlantic. Carney provides a new understanding of the contributions that enslaved Africans made to American culture. An outstanding work."&#x2015;Gail E. Wagner, University of South Carolina<br><br>"Following on the heels of her magnificent book <i>Black Rice</i>, Judith Carney delves deeper into the invisible history of the Black Atlantic's foodways. She provides nothing less than a radical re-reading of the role of Africans in shaping not simply New World agrarian systems but the ways in which food was processed, how animals were reared, husbanded and tended, and how African knowledge and practice contributed to the global table. <i>In the Shadow of Slavery</i> is a remarkable narrative achievement, a rich account of endurance, innovation, survival, travel and historical memory nourished not so much on the estates and plantations as on the slave plots, and in the hearths and kitchens of those who survived the Middle Passage. A tour de force."&#x2015;Michael Watts, editor of <i>Curse Of The Black Gold: 50 Years of Oil in the Niger Delta</i><br><br>&#x201c;In this brilliant book, Judith Carney charts the diaspora of African flora that resulted largely as an unintended consequence of the forced migration of Africans from the Old World to the New. European slave ships unwittingly carried Africa's botanical heritage along with the people who valued it to the Americas. Africans cultivated foods crucial to their very survival in what Carney beautifully styles 'botanical gardens of the dispossessed'.

Today, new technologies make it possible to roam instantly and experimentally across musical languages and generations, from Detroit techno to jam bands to baroque opera&#x2015;or to dive deeper into the set of tastes that we already have. Either way, we can listen to nearly anything, at any time. The possibilities in this new age of listening overturn old assumptions about what it means to properly appreciate music&#x2015;to be an &#x201c;educated&#x201d; listener.<br> In <i>Every Song Ever</i>, the veteran <i>New York Times</i> music critic Ben Ratliff reimagines the very idea of music appreciation for our times. As familiar subdivisions like &#x201c;rock&#x201d; and &#x201c;jazz&#x201d; matter less and less and music&#x2019;s accessible past becomes longer and broader, listeners can put aside the intentions of composers and musicians and engage music afresh, on their own terms. Ratliff isolates signal musical traits&#x2015;such as repetition, speed, and virtuosity&#x2015;and traces them across wildly diverse recordings to reveal unexpected connections. When we listen for slowness, for instance, we may detect surprising affinities between the drone metal of Sunn O))), the mixtape manipulations of DJ Screw, Sarah Vaughan singing &#x201c;Lover Man,&#x201d; and the final works of Shostakovich. And if we listen for closeness, we might notice how the tight harmonies of bluegrass vocals illuminate the virtuosic synchrony of John Coltrane&#x2019;s quartet. Ratliff also goes in search of &#x201c;the perfect moment&#x201d;; considers what it means to hear emotion by sampling the complex sadness that powers the music of Nick Drake and Slayer; and examines the meaning of certain common behaviors, such as the impulse to document and possess the entire performance history of the Grateful Dead.<br> Encompassing the sounds of five continents and several centuries, Ratliff&#x2019;s book is an artful work of criticism and a lesson in open-mindedness. It is a definitive field guide to our radically altered musical habitat.</p></p><p><b>Ben Ratliff</b> has been a jazz and pop critic for <i>The New York Times</i> since 1996.

Ratliff celebrates the virtues of play and resistance, and knows that just as stabbing at a single note can fend off easy enchantment, so can seeking out lots of different sounds.

I was able to cobble together most of Ratliff&#x2019;s 'wasteful mastery' playlist, including songs by artists such as [Dean] Martin, Lil Wayne, Lou Reed, Fats Waller, Young Thug, and Nina Simone. It&#x2019;s a hoot, and it sold me on the book&#x2019;s central concept." <b>&#x2015;Devin Leonard, <i>Bloomberg Businessweek</i></b></p><p>"In this insightful guide to contemporary music appreciation, genre limitations are off the table . . . Ratliff&#x2019;s scholarship shines; there&#x2019;s a lot to be said for a book on music appreciation that can draw apt parallels between DJ Screw and Bernstein&#x2019;s rendition of Mahler&#x2019;s ninth symphony." <b>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><p>"It&#x2019;s fascinating how Ratliff can bring a fresh ear to such familiar music . . .

Over the course of the centuries, Bible scholars and publishers have increasingly added "helps"&#x2015;chapter divisions, verses, subheads, notes&#x2015;to the Bible in an effort to make it easier to study and understand. In the process, however, these have led to sampling Scripture rather than reading deeply. According to author Glenn R. Paauw, the text has become divorced from the Bible's literary and historical context, leading to misinterpretation and a "narrow, individualistic and escapist view of salvation." Rather than being a culture-shaping force, the Bible has become a database of quick and easy answers to life's troubling questions. But these deficiencies can be corrected by engaging in what the author calls "big readings." In these pages Paauw introduces us to seven new (to us) understandings of the Bible as steps on the path to recovering one deeply engaged Bible. With each "new" Bible presented, deficiencies in how we currently interact with the Bible are explored, followed by recommendations for a new practice. The Bible's transformative power is recovered when we remove the chains Christians have applied to it over the centuries. The Bible does not need to be saved because of any defect in itself, but because we have distorted and misread it. <em>Saving the Bible from Ourselves</em> provides students of the Bible a new paradigm for reading and living the Bible well.</p><p><strong>Glenn R. Paauw</strong> is vice president, global Bible engagment, at Biblica and a senior fellow at the Institute for Bible Reading. A native of Colorado, Glenn loves to climb the state?s 14,000-foot peaks and to cycle the back roads of the Front Range."As someone who has participated in creating a Bible translation and a study Bible, I found Paauw's arguments thought-provoking and convicting. . . . This is a great book for anyone who is interested in thinking deeply about our engagement with the Bible and how it could be improved." (Elliot Ritzema, Bible Study Magazine, November/December 2016)<br><br>"Those looking for a refreshing approach to Bible studies can find enriching insights in <em>Saving the Bible from Ourselves</em>." (Taylor Berglund, Charisma, July 2016)<br><br>"Well-written, thought-provoking, and bold." (David Mundt, CBA Retailers + Resources, May, 16, 2016)<br><br>"Because the Bible remains foundational to all Christian life, it is a very good thing to be reminded regularly how it should be put to use. Glenn Paauw's clear, thoughtful and historically well-informed book explains ways of reading, marking and inwardly digesting Scripture that draw their wisdom from Scripture itself. The same wisdom provides welcome encouragement not only to learn from but to love the written Word of God." (Mark Noll, author of In the Beginning Was the Word)<br><br>"Glenn Paauw has written a serious and compelling book on the Bible. The tone of his writing is puckish enough to keep us turning pages for more. After identifying our lazy readiness to reduce the Bible to convenient 'scripturettes,' Paauw guides us to a way to the adult work of serious engagement with the Bible. When the Bible is taken with such seriousness, it will indeed serve to refresh and revive the missional energy of the church. His argument is propelled by the deep conviction that gospel alternatives are on offer for the bold, alert and passionate who engage the biblical text beyond our narcoticized habits of reading."

Until Mary's incredible discovery, it was widely believed that animals did not become extinct. The child of a poor family, Mary became a fossil hunter, inspiring the tongue-twister, "She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore." She attracted the attention of fossil collectors and eventually the scientific world. Once news of the fossils reached the halls of academia, it became impossible to ignore the truth. Mary's peculiar finds helped lay the groundwork for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, laid out in his <i>On the Origin of Species.</i> Darwin drew on Mary's fossilized creatures as irrefutable evidence that life in the past was nothing like life in the present. </p><p>A story worthy of Dickens, <i>The Fossil Hunter</i> chronicles the life of this young girl, with dirt under her fingernails and not a shilling to buy dinner, who became a world-renowned paleontologist. Dickens himself said of Mary: "The carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and deserved to win it."</p><p>Here at last, Shelley Emling returns Mary Anning, of whom Stephen J. Gould remarked, is "probably the most important unsung (or inadequately sung) collecting force in the history of paleontology," to her deserved place in history.</p></p><p><p><b>Shelley Emling</b> has been a journalist for twenty years. She is a foreign correspondent for Cox Newspapers, and her work has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Fortune</i>, <i>USA</i><i> Today</i>, and <i>The International Herald Tribune</i>. She lives in London.</p><p>&#x201c;Emling writes with a style that makes <i>The Fossil Hunter</i> very hard to put down before reaching the last page.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Winnepeg Free Press</i></p><p>&#x201c;Readable, journalistic, Emling's amply footnoted book skillfully puts Anning's work into the scientific and sociological context.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Released just weeks after Tracy Chevalier's fictional account of Anning's life, Emling's account pays tribute to Anning in an original and gripping historical biography.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Dinosaurs are astonishing today -- and we've had several hundred years of biology to help us absorb the shock. Imagine the shock caused by these monster creatures discovered and presented by a poor, twelve-year old girl, in the early 19th century. This is the remarkable story that Emling tells so well, evoking a world far from ours that in just a few years took a destitute pre-teen scavenging the crumbling cliffs of Lyme Regis to the pages of the leading scientific journals of her time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Galison, author of Einstein's Clock's and Poincare's Maps and Joseph Pellegrino University Professor, Harvard University</i></p><p>&#x201c;Shelley Emling vividly brings to life the fascinating story of Mary Anning, the greatest fossil hunter of the early nineteenth century. Anning single-handedly recovered an extraordinary collection of fossils of marine and flying reptiles that helped shape the way we now see the incredibly long history of life on Earth. With this enjoyable book, Emling gives Anning her deserved place in history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Hans Sues, Associate Director of Research and Collections, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Fossil Hunter </i>at long last brings to life one of the central figures in the early golden age of paleontological discovery -- a woman of great diligence, and passion, and with a keen eye for fossil bone in the rock. As a young child, I was greatly inspired by Mary Anning. As an adult, working paleontologist, I remain so, a conviction doubtless reinforced by Shelley Emling's fascinating book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Novacek, Provost, American Museum of Natural History</i></p><p>&#x201c;Emling does an excellent job of knitting together a highly readable title on her life, reaching into sources for Anning's contemporaries and scientific publications from the time which describes the fossils she found. It is rare that readers discover someone like them who changed the world. That's Mary Anning however, and as Shelley Emling shows, it wasn't easy. But she did it anyway and now, at last, we can appreciate how.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bookslut</i></p><p>&#x201c;Emling tells a fascinating tale. . . she marshals an immense amount of information about the world of 19th-century geology and paleontology, detailing the controversies about the meaning of the layers of rock and the increasing evidence that animals can indeed become extinct. . . Valuable because it trains a well-deserved spotlight on Anning, explicates some of the philosophical dilemmas of 19th-century science, and incidentally, also notes several other women who became expert fossil hunters and collectors.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;A well-written book is one of the most effective, and enjoyable, ways to become acquainted with the women who made such gains in history, but have yet to be fully recognized for their significant contributions. Shelley Emling has written such a book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>National Women's History Project</i></p><p>&#x201c;We know so much because of Mary Anning, but as Emling makes clear, we sadly know very little about Mary Anning, something the author does a wonderful job of changing here.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bookslut</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this breezy biography...the unlikely life story of uneducated, lower-class girl turned respected 19th-century paleontologist Mary Anning is, in Emling's hands, an inspiring one.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bust</i></p></p><h2>Language for Writing, Student Textbook (softcover) (DISTAR LANGUAGE SERIES)</h2><p><p>Use <em>Language for Writing</em> to lead your students toward independence as writers.

It also includes authentic excerpts from works by 20th&#x2013;century Japanese masters Mishima, Akutagawa, Kawabata, and others. <br><br>Although <i>A Japanese Reader</i> supposes some acquaintance with the spoken Japanese language, it does not assume any knowledge of written Japanese and starts from and very beginning, advancing in graded readings up through quite difficult materials. Learning the modern Japanese written language is by no means a difficult task for the student of the Japanese language as it is often made to appear. The most important thing in such a study is to get yourself started in the correct direction&#x2014;after that, the progress you make and the eventual proficiency you will gain in reading (and writing) the language are limited only by the amount of time and effort you are able or willing to devote to the task. Attention has been given throughout the volume to grading materials in the order of progressive difficulty, though in many cases familiarity on the part of a student with the subject matter involved may well make a particular selection somewhat easier for him than others further on in the book. Partly to assist in the understanding of the reading selections and partly because it is felt that few students will wish to become proficient in reading Japanese and still remain uninterested in Japanese culture and cultural history, an attempt has also been made to indicate where possible significant collateral readings available in English, especially for some of the sections which deal with distinctive aspects of Japanese life and culture.<ul><li> <b>Lessons 1 through 17</b> deal with the essentials of the Japanese writing system, as it is used in Japan today.</li><li> <b>Lessons 18 through 30</b> deal with building a working knowledge of Japanese grammar and introducing the Japanese system of writing.</li><li> <b>Lessons 31 through 38</b> are selections of intermediate difficulty and largely deal with Japanese life and customs. Included are readings of Japanese literature, archaeology, ceramic art, painting, Buddhism, the theater, and political science and philosophy.</li><li> <b>Lessons 48 through 59</b> are of increasing difficulty and include criticisms, resumes, a short text from Meiji and Taisho literature, and excerpts from important Japanese novels.</li><li> <b>Lessons 60 through 75</b> are of advanced difficulty and provided further readings with a considerable variety of content including Sinology, Zen Buddhism, Shinto, Christianity, newspapers, economics and finance, and Japanese government policies.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>Hartmann &amp; Kester's Plant Propagation: Principles and Practices (8th Edition)</h2><p>The world standard for plant propagation and horticulture for over 50 years, <i>Hartmann and Kester&#x2019;s Plant Propagation</i> continues to be the field&#x2019;s most complete, up-to-date text on plant propagation.

How did it relate to the diverse beliefs and practices that characterized this fascinating period? Richard Kieckhefer surveys the growth and development of magic in medieval times. He examines its relation to religion, science, philosophy, art, literature and politics before introducing us to the different types of magic, the kinds of people who practiced magic, and the reasoning behind their beliefs. This book places magic at the crossroads of medieval culture, shedding light on many other aspects of life in the Middle Ages.</p><p>'Richard Kieckhefer offers a panoramic view of a very diverse set of problems in his cogently organised and revealing book ... imaginative and stimulating ...'. Journal of Medieval History<br><br>'... a readable and lively book, whose particular strengths are its confidence and clarity in defining different sorts of magical activities, and the sharp illustrative details ... he deserves congratulations.'

BBC History Magazine</p><h2>The Parables: Jewish Tradition and Christian Interpretation</h2><p>Fully one-third of Jesusï¿½&#x2019; words in the Synoptic Gospels occur in parables. It could be said that knowing the parables is essential for understanding the person of Christ. In his newest work on the parables, Brad Young displays his unique perspective as a scholar steeped in both Jewish and Christian studies. While parables have timeless messages, reinterpretations in new contexts throughout the centuries have distorted the original meanings and undermined the essence of what Jesus intended for his initial listeners. Young examines the parables that best illustrate the parallels between the rabbinic and Gospel parables. Young challenges readers to remember that first-century Judaism was not merely the backdrop for Jesusï¿½&#x2019; teachings but the very stage from which Jesus delivered the message of the kingdom. Jesusï¿½&#x2019; ethics and theology can be properly understood only in the light of first-century Jewish teachings. Young focuses on the historical development and theological significance of parables in both traditions, then he examines five theological subjects that are dealt with in parables: prayer, grace, reconciliation, calling, and sovereignty. <p>"This great new book by Brad H. Young is a decisive step in the right direction. Like his previous books, this innovative work on the parables shows that Jesus is both a foundation of the Christian faith and at the same time an integral part of Second Temple period Judaism. Jewish thought is notï¿½&#x2014;as is often claimedï¿½&#x2014;merely a background for Jesus but is in reality the original context and natural framework of his message. Few people have recognized this basic fact, not only because of inveterate Christian inhibitions but also because it is a very rare case that a New Testament scholar can break the language barrier and move freely in the Hebrew and Aramaic sources of early Judaism proficiently, as Young is able to do. Similarly, Jewish scholars often do not use their advantage in this area of research and sometimes cannot move freely in the Christian material because even they are not always free from their own inherited inhibitions. All who are involved in the study of Judaism, however, as well as everyone seeking a better understanding of Jesus, will be challenged by Young's creative and solid research."

How are generalizations that are warranted to be distinguished from those that are not? Goodman shows that these questions resist formal solution and his demonstration has been taken by nativists like Chomsky and Fodor as proof that neither scientific induction nor ordinary learning can proceed without an <i>a priori</i>, or innate, ordering of hypotheses.</p><p>In his new foreword to this edition, Hilary Putnam forcefully rejects these nativist claims. The controversy surrounding these unsolved problems is as relevant to the psychology of cognitive development as it is to the philosophy of science.

Or topping off that hat trick with an astonishing fifty-yard strike from midfield, the greatest goal in U.S. soccer history, a shot so audacious that it's surprising to learn that Lloyd had actually practiced it for years with [James] Galanis on an empty field in New Jersey, far from any crowds.&#x201d; &#x2014;</b><b>Grant Wahl, </b><i><b>Sports Illustrated</b></i><br><br> In 2015, the U.S .Women&#x2019;s National Soccer Team won its first FIFA championship in sixteen years,&nbsp;culminating in an epic final game that electrified soccer fans around the world.

In 2003 she was struggling, her&nbsp;soccer career at a crossroads. Then she found a trusted trainer, James Galanis, who saw in Carli a player with raw talent, skill, and a great dedication to the game. What Carli lacked were fitness, mental toughness, and character. Together they set to work, training day and night, fighting, grinding it out. No one worked harder than Carli. And no one believed in her more than James. Despite all the naysayers, the times she was benched, moments when her self-confidence took a nosedive, she succeeded in becoming one of the best players in the world.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This candid reflection on a remarkable turnaround will take readers inside the women's national team and inside the head of an athlete who willed herself to perform at the highest levels of competition.</p><p>CARLI LLOYD is captain of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team and has been named the FIFA World Player of the Year for two years in a row (2015 and 2016).

The Constitution, he observes, grants individual rights in extremely abstract terms. The First Amendment prohibits the passing of laws that "abridge the freedom of speech"; the Fifth Amendment insists on "due process of law"; and the Fourteenth Amendment demands "equal protection of the laws" for all persons. What does that abstract language mean when it is applied to the political controversies that divide Americans--about affirmative action and racial justice, abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, censorship, pornography, and homosexuality, for example? Judges, and ultimately the justices of the Supreme Court, must decide for everyone, and that gives them great power. How should they decide? </p><p> Dworkin defends a particular answer to that question, which he calls the <i>moral reading</i> of the Constitution. He argues that the Bill of Rights must be understood as setting out general moral principles about liberty and equality and dignity, and that private citizens, lawyers, and finally judges must interpret and apply those general principles by posing and trying to answer more concrete moral questions. Is freedom to choose abortion really a basic moral right and would curtailing that right be a deep injustice, for example? Why? In the detailed discussions of individual constitutional issues that form the bulk of the book, Dworkin shows that our judges do decide hard constitutional cases by posing and answering such concrete moral questions. Indeed he shows that that is the only way they <i>can</i> decide those cases. </p><p> But most judges--and most politicians and most law professors--pretend otherwise. They say that judges must never treat constitutional issues as moral issues because that would be <i>undemocratic</i>--it would mean that judges were substituting their own moral convictions for those of Congressmen and state legislators who had been elected by the people. So they insist that judges can, and should, decide in some more mechanical way which involves no fresh moral judgment on their part. </p><p> The result, Dworkin shows, has been great constitutional confusion. Is the premise at the core of this confusion really sound? Is the moral reading--the only reading of the American Constitution that makes sense--really undemocratic? In spirited and illuminating discussions both of the great constitutional cases of recent years, and of general constitutional principles, Dworkin argues, to the contrary, that the distinctly American version of government under principle, based on the moral reading of the Constitution, is in fact the best account of what democracy really is. </p></p><p><i>Freedom's Law</i> is Dworkin's impassioned defense of free speech and conscience. The thread that ties these essays together is his criticism of strict historical interpretation of the Constitution, which holds that our modern-day understanding must be strictly limited to the concerns of the Constitution's framers, rather than the underlying principles embodied within. Divided into three parts, the book examines the soundness of Roe v. Wade, defends a broad reading of the First Amendment and attacks the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.This book argues that Americans have been systematically misled about what their Constitution is and how judges interpret it. In spirited cases and general constitutional principles, Ronald Dworkin argues that a distinctly American version of government based on the moral reading of the Constitution is in fact the best account of what democracy really is.</p><h2>Western Civilization: Volume II: Since 1500</h2><p>Join the more than one million students who have used Spielvogel&#39;s texts to be successful in their Western civilization course.

Picture-Perfect Science Lessons makes that exciting idea a reality. This delightful book for new and experienced elementary teachers presents 15 ready-to-teach lessons complete with student pages and assessments that use picture books to guide science inquiry explicitly tied to the National Science Education Standards. The authors are experts. They re classroom veterans who have honed their approach to teaching science through their presentation of Toyota Tapestry-funded workshops to teachers nationwide. They know that elementary teachers are usually crunched for science instructional time and could often use refresher explanations of scientific concepts. So they show you exactly how to combine science and reading in a natural way, and they provide easy-to-grasp background in physical science, life science, and Earth and space science. The lessons are classroom-tested, clearly identify the appropriate Standards, and embed carefully selected reading strategies throughout. Picture-Perfect Science Lessons draws on such diverse and tempting books as Dr. Xargle s Book of Earthlets, Oil Spill, Sheep in a Jeep, and Weird Friends: Unlikely Allies in the Animal Kingdom. You ll love how effective this book is, and your students will love learning about science.</p><p><b>Karen Ansberry</b> is a former classroom teacher who understands that teachers are crunched for time and need high-interest, ready-to-use lessons that integrate literature, reading strategies, and science.

The book begins by outlining an argument for using such literature in science and provides best practice methods for reading picture books aloud to children. The first chapter defines a picture book as being ...unique to children s literature as they are defined by format rather than content. That is, they are books in which the illustrations are of equal importance as or more important than the text in the creation of meaning (Strickland and Morrow 2000). Picture books tend to capture the interest of children for longer periods of time and lend themselves to comprehension strategy practice. The book gave four research-based arguments for using picture books. First, they give context for concepts. Rather than having student memorize lists of facts, books give a real-life context in which new concepts can better be learned and observed. Second, picture books provide a greater depth of coverage. Unlike textbooks which often give broad coverage on many topics, picture books allow for in-depth coverage on one topic. Third, research shows that children showed great gains in literacy skills when introduced to children s literature and literacy instruction in the science program. Their attitude towards science also improved. Finally, using picture books within the science curriculum provided opportunities to correct science misconceptions. Repetition of the correct concept by reading several books, doing a number of experiments, and inviting scientists to the classroom can facilitate a conceptual change in children (Miller, Steiner, and Larson 1996). The second chapter gave tips for reading aloud and reading comprehension strategies. The authors also listed tools for improving reading comprehension including anticipation guides, visual representations, rereading, stop and jot, think-pair-share, and word sorts. The third and fourth chapters discussed using an inquiry model and leading children through prediction, inferring, and questioning. The authors introduce us to the BSCS Instruction Model (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) and the 5E model. The 5E model is Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate. The purpose of the Engage stage is to capture students attention. The Explore stage provides opportunities for students to engage in activities, giving them concrete experiences, concepts and skills.

At the evaluate stage, the teacher is able to assess student s understanding and give opportunity for students to self-evaluate. The remainder of the book lays out each chapter as a lesson plan, including goals, objectives, all required materials, activities, questions and a rubric for assessment. Each chapter provides the worksheets needed for the activities and lays out each lesson according to the 5E model. I would highly recommend this book for its many strategies and usability. --Reviewed by: Melanie Zook on May 5, 2008</p><h2>Survey of Economics: Principles, Applications, and Tools (6th Edition)</h2><p><i>For one semester Principles of Economics courses.

As witches prophesy mysteriously and storms rage, ambition and deceit converge; treacherous murder breeds uncontrollable violence. </p><p>Written during the reign of King James I, Shakespeare's Macbeth is an intense examination of the corrupting nature of power, the ability of humans to choose their own destinies, and the lengths to which people will go to satisfy their own desires. Its direct, driving plot carries us from homicide to chaos to war with incredible force and speed. </p><p>To make Macbeth more accessible to the modern reader, our Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Edition includes a glossary of the more difficult words, as well as convenient sidebar notes to enlighten the reader on aspects that may be confusing or overlooked.

Even people who would never have thought that a religious problem could be a serious matter that concerned them personally are beginning to ask themselves fundamental questions. Under these circumstances it would not be at all surprising if those sections of the community who ask themselves nothing were visited by `visions,' by a widespread myth seriously believed in by some and rejected as absurd by others."--C. G. Jung, in <i>Flying Saucers</i><br> ?</p><br><p> Jung's primary concern in <i>Flying Saucers</i> is not with the reality or unreality of UFOs but with their psychic aspect. Rather than speculate about their possible nature and extraterrestrial origin as alleged spacecraft, he asks what it may signify that these phenomena, whether real or imagined, are seen in such numbers just at a time when humankind is menaced as never before in history. The UFOs represent, in Jung's phrase, "a modern myth."</p></p><p>While Jung is known mainly for his theories on the nature of the unconscious mind, he did have an interest in the paranormal. In this essay, Jung applies his analytical skills to the UFO phenomenon. Rather than assuming that the modern prevalence of UFO sightings are due to extraterrestrial craft, Jung reserves judgment on their origin and connects UFOs with archetypal imagery, concluding that they have become a &#34;living myth.&#34; This essay is intriguing in its methodology and implications as to the nature of UFOs and their relation to the human psyche.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Working The Plate: The Art of Food Presentation</h2><p>Feast your eyes.<br>Long awaited by professional chefs, this groundbreaking guide to food presentation will also delight and inspire culinary students and sophisticated home cooks.

This book offers a concise overview of this new multidisciplinary field, presenting concepts, issues, current research, concrete examples, and case studies. Robert Emmett and David Nye show how humanists, by offering constructive knowledge as well as negative critique, can improve our understanding of such environmental problems as global warming, species extinction, and over-consumption of the earth's resources. They trace the genealogy of environmental humanities from European, Australian, and American initiatives, also showing its cross-pollination by postcolonial and feminist theories. </p><p>Emmett and Nye consider a concept of place not synonymous with localism, the risks of ecotourism, and the cultivation of wild areas. They discuss the decoupling of energy use and progress, and point to OECD countries for examples of sustainable development. They explain the potential for science to do both good and harm, examine dark visions of planetary collapse, and describe more positive possibilities&#x2015;alternative practices, including localization and degrowth. Finally, they examine the theoretical impact of new materialism, feminism, postcolonial criticism, animal studies, and queer ecology on the environmental humanities.</p></p><p>Robert Emmett is Visiting Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at Roanoke College and author of <i>Cultivating Environmental Justice: A Literary History of U.S. Garden Writing</i>.<p>This book is the best introduction to a dynamic field. It is perfect for fomenting lively classroom discussion of so many of this era's essential issues: climate change, animal sentience, environmental justice, digital and analog forms of representing the environment, the Anthropocene, food and water security, urban futures, and sustainable energy. The writing is conceptually informed, yet lucid and grounded throughout by international and interdisciplinary examples. A tour de force.</p>&#x2015;<b>Rob Nixon</b>, Barron Family Professor in Humanities and Environment, Princeton University; author of <i>Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor</i><br><br><p>Just as Emma Marris synthesized the recent work of conservation biologists in their search for novel solutions to life in the Anthropocene, so too have Emmett and Nye given us an elegant meditation on two decades of work by environmental scholars of the humanities. More than a literature review, the book makes a convincing case, for all those who need it, that our futures are contingent on the non-perfunctory understanding and appreciation for the social and cultural values that undergird our environmental problems as well as the solutions.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gary Kroll</b>, Professor of History at SUNY Plattsburgh; author of <i>America's Ocean Wilderness</i><br><br><p>In this neat, compact, yet very rich volume Robert Emmett and David Nye demonstrate that the environmental humanities is a cross-cutting intellectual adventure that will not only stimulate knowledge and catalyze the humanities but will also affect the transition to sustainable societies. It is an excellent introduction to a vibrant field which is too vast for anyone to fully fathom. They have selected well, they write accessibly, their judgment is sound.</p>&#x2015;<b>Sverker Sï¿½rlin</b>, Professor of Environmental History, Division of History of Science, Technology and Environment, KTH Royal Institute of Technology</p><h2>Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in Counseling (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

What they heard was a new kind of sound that was the product of modern technology. They listened as newly critical consumers of aural commodities.

The control provided by these technologies, however, was applied in ways that denied the particularity of place, and the diverse spaces of modern America began to sound alike as a universal new sound predominated. Although this sound&#x2015;clear, direct, efficient, and nonreverberant&#x2015;had little to say about the physical spaces in which it was produced, it speaks volumes about the culture that created it.

Chris's questionable intentions toward her daughter are, however, the least of Kate's worries since she was once, and still is, deeply in love with him. Kate's moral quandary and the ensuing drama evoke comparison with Oedipus and Hamlet and lead to an ending that startled the mores of the day.</p><p>Edith Wharton&nbsp;(1862&#x2013;1937) was an American novelist&#x2014;the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for her novel&nbsp;<i>The Age of Innocence&nbsp;</i>in 1921&#x2014;as well as a short story writer, playwright, designer, reporter, and poet. Born into one of New York's elite families, she drew upon her knowledge of upper class aristocracy to realistically portray the lives and morals of the Gilded Age.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Kate Clephane was wakened, as usual, by the slant of Riviera sun across her bed. It was the thing she liked best about her shabby cramped room in the third-rate Hï¿½tel de Minorque et de l'Univers: that the morning sun came in at her window, and yet that it didn't come too early.<br><br>No more sunrises for Kate Clephane. They were associated with too many lost joys -- coming home from balls where one had danced one's self to tatters, or from suppers where one had lingered, counting one's winnings (it was wonderful, in the old days, how often she had won, or friends had won for her, staking a <i>louis</i> just for fun, and cramming her hands with thousand franc bills); associated, too, with the scramble up hill through the whitening gray of the garden, flicked by scented shrubs, caught on perfidious prickles, up to the shuttered villa askew on its heat-soaked rock -- and then, at the door, in the laurustinus-shade that smelt of honey, that unexpected kiss (well honestly, yes, unexpected, since it had long been settled that one was to remain "just friends"); and the pulling away from an insistent arm, and the one more pressure on hers of lips young enough to be fresh after a night of drinking and play and more drinking. And she had never let Chris come in with her at that hour, no, not once, though at the time there was only Julie the cook in the house, and goodness knew...Oh, but she had always had her pride -- people ought to remember <i>that</i> when they said such things about her...<br><br>That was what the sunrise reminded Kate Clephane of -- as she supposed it did most women of forty-two or so (or was it really forty-four last week?). For nearly twenty years now she had lived chiefly with women of her own kind, and she no longer very sincerely believed there were any others, that is to say among women properly so called. Her female world was made up of three categories: frumps, hypocrites and the "good sort" -- like herself. After all, the last was the one she preferred to be in.<br><br>Not that she could not picture another life -- if only one had met the right man at the right hour. She remembered her one week -- that tiny little week of seven days, just six years ago -- when she and Chris had gone together to a lost place in Normandy where there wasn't a railway within ten miles, and you had to drive in the farmer's cart to the farm-house smothered in apple-blossoms; and Chris and she had gone off every morning for the whole day, while he sketched by willowy river-banks, and under the flank of mossy village churches; and every day for seven days she had watched the farmyard life waking at dawn under their windows, while she dashed herself with cold water and did her hair and touched up her face before he was awake, because the early light is so pitiless after thirty. She remembered it all, and how sure she had been then that she was meant to live on a farm and keep chickens; just as sure as he was that he was meant to be a painter, and would already have made a name if his parents hadn't called him back to Baltimore and shoved him into a broker's office after Harvard -- to have him off their minds, as he said.<br><br>Yes, she could still picture that kind of life: every fibre in her kept its glow. But she didn't believe in it; she knew now that "things didn't happen like that" for long, that reality and durability were attributes of the humdrum, the prosaic and the dreary. And it was to escape from reality and durability that one plunged into cards, gossip, flirtation, and all the artificial excitements which society so lavishly provides for people who want to forget.<br><br>She and Chris had never repeated that week. He had never suggested doing so, and had let her hints fall unheeded, or turned them off with a laugh, whenever she tried, with shy tentative allusions, to coax him back to the idea; for she had found out early that one could never ask him anything point-blank -- it just put his back up, as he said himself. One had to manoeuvre and wait; but when didn't a woman have to manoeuvre and wait? Ever since she had left her husband, eighteen years ago, what else had she ever done? Sometimes, nowadays, waking Aline and unrefreshed in her dreary hotel room, she shivered at the memory of all the scheming, planning, ignoring, enduring, accepting, which had led her in the end to -- this.<br><br>Ah, well --<br><br>"Aline!"<br><br>After all, there was the sun in her window, there was the triangular glimpse of blue wind-bitten sea between the roofs, and a new day beginning, and hot chocolate coming, and a new hat to try on at the milliner's, and --<br><br><i>"Aline!"</i><br><br>She had come to this cheap hotel just in order to keep her maid. One couldn't afford everything, especially since the war, and she preferred veal for dinner every night to having to do her own mending and dress her hair: the unmanageable abundant hair which had so uncannily survived her youth, and sometimes, in her happier moods, made her feel that perhaps, after all, in the eyes of her friends, other of its attributes survived also. And besides, it looked better for a lone woman who, after having been thirty-nine for a number of years, had suddenly become forty-four, to have a respectable-looking servant in the background; to be able, for instance, when one arrived in new places, to say to supercilious hotel-clerks: "My maid is following with the luggage."<br><br><i>"Aline!"</i><br><br>Aline, ugly, neat and enigmatic, appeared with the breakfast-tray. A delicious scent preceded her.<br><br>Mrs. Clephane raised herself on a pink elbow, shook her hair over her shoulders, and exclaimed: "Violets?"<br><br>Aline permitted herself her dry smile. "From a gentleman."<br><br>Colour flooded her mistress's face. Hadn't she known that something good was going to happen to her that morning -- hadn't she felt it in every touch of the sunshine, as its golden finger-tips pressed her lids open and wound their way through her hair? She supposed she was superstitious. She laughed expectantly.<br><br>"A gentleman?"<br><br>"The little lame boy with the newspapers that Madame was kind to," the maid continued, arranging the tray with her spare Taylorized gestures.<br><br>"Oh, poor child!" Mrs. Clephane's voice had a quaver which she tried to deflect to the lame boy, though she knew how impossible it was to deceive Aline. Of course Aline knew everything -- well, yes, that was the other side of the medal. She often said to her mistress: "Madame is too much Aline -- Madame ought to make some new friends --" and what did that mean, except that Aline knew she had lost the old ones?<br><br>But it was characteristic of Kate that, after a moment, the quaver in her voice did instinctively tilt in the direction of the lame boy who sold newspapers; and when the tears reached her eyes it was over his wistful image, and not her own, that they flowed. She had a way of getting desperately fond of people she had been kind to, and exaggeratedly touched by the least sign of their appreciation. It was her weakness -- or her strength: she wondered which?<br><br>"Poor, poor little chap. But his mother'll beat him if she finds out. Aline, you must hunt him up this very day and pay back what the flowers must have cost him." She lifted the violets and pressed them to her face. As she did so she caught sight of a telegram beneath them.<br><br>A telegram -- for her? It didn't often happen nowadays. But after all there was no reason why it shouldn't happen once again -- at least once. There was no reason why, this very day, this day on which the sunshine had waked her with such a promise, there shouldn't be a message at last, the message for which she had waited for two years, three years; yes, exactly three years and one month -- just a word from him to say: <i>"Take me back."</i><br><br>She snatched up the telegram, and then turned her head toward the wall, seeking, while she read, to hide her face from Aline. The maid, on whom such hints were never lost, immediately transferred her attention to the dressing-table, skilfully deploying the glittering troops on that last battlefield where the daily struggle still renewed itself.<br><br>Aline's eyes averted, her mistress tore open the blue fold and read: "Mrs. Clephane dead --"<br><br>A shiver ran over her. <i>Mrs. Clephane dead?</i> Not if Mrs. Clephane knew it! Never more alive than today, with the sun crisping her hair, the violet scent enveloping her, and that jolly north-west gale rioting out there on the Mediterranean. What was the meaning of this grim joke?<br><br>The first shock over, she read on more calmly and understood. It was the other Mrs. Clephane who was dead: the one who used to be her mother-in-law. Her first thought was: "Well, serve her right" -- since, if it was so desirable to be alive on such a morning it must be correspondingly undesirable to be dead, and she could draw the agreeable conclusion that the other Mrs. Clephane had at last been come up with -- oh, but thoroughly.<br><br>She lingered awhile on this pleasing fancy, and then began to reach out to wider inferences. "But if -- but -- if but little Anne --"<br><br>At the murmur of the name her eyes filled again. For years now she had barricaded her heart against her daughter's presence; and here it was, suddenly in possession again, crowding out everything else, yes, effacing even Chris as though he were the thinnest of ghosts, and the cable in her hand a cockcrow. "But perhaps now they'll let me see her," the mother thought.<br><br>She didn't even know who "they" were, now that their formidable chieftain, her mother-in-law, was dead. Lawyers, judges, trustees, guardians, she supposed -- all the natural enemies of woman. She wrinkled her brows, trying to remember who, at the death of the child's father, had been appointed the child's other guardian -- old Mrs. Clephane's overpowering assumption of the office having so completely effaced her associate that it took a few minutes to fish him up out of the far-off past.<br><br>"Why, poor old Fred Landers, of course!" She smiled retrospectively. "I don't believe he'd prevent my seeing the child if he were left to himself. Besides, isn't she nearly grown up? Why, I do believe she must be."<br><br>The telegram fell from her hands, both of which she now impressed into a complicated finger-reckoning of how old little Anne must be, if Chris were thirty-three, as he certainly was -- no, thirty-one, he couldn't be more than thirty-one, because <i>she,</i> Kate, was only forty-two...yes, forty-two...and she'd always acknowledged to herself that there were nine years between them; no, eleven years, if she were really forty-two; yes, but was she? Or, goodness, was she actually forty-five? Well, then, if she was forty-five -- just supposing it for a minute -- and had married John Clephane at twenty-one, as she knew she had, and little Anne had been born the second summer afterward, then little Anne must be nearly twenty...why, quite twenty, wasn't it? But then, how old would <i>that</i> make Chris? Oh, well, he <i>must</i> be older than he looked...she'd always thought he was. That boyish way of his, she had sometimes fancied, was put on to make her imagine there was a greater difference of age between them than there really was -- a device he was perfectly capable of making use of for ulterior purposes. And of course she'd never been that dreadful kind of woman they called a "baby-snatcher"...But if Chris were thirty-one, and she forty-five, then how old <i>was</i> Anne?<br><br>With impatient fingers she began all over again.<br><br>The maid's voice, seeming to come from a long way off, respectfully reminded her that the chocolate would be getting cold. Mrs. Clephane roused herself, looked about the room, and exclaimed: "My looking-glass, please." She wanted to settle that question of ages.<br><br>As Aline approached with the glass there was a knock at the door. The maid went to it, and came back with her small inward smile.<br><br>"Another telegram."<br><br>Another? This time Mrs. Clephane sat bolt upright. What could it be, now, but a word from him, a message at last? Oh, but she was ashamed of herself for thinking of such a thing at such a moment. Solitude had demoralized her, she supposed. And then her child was so far away, so invisible, so unknown -- and Chris of a sudden had become so near and real again, though it was three whole years and one month since he had left her. And at her age -- She opened the second message, trembling. Since Armistice Day her heart had not beat so hard.<br><br>"New York. Dearest mother," it ran, "I want you to come home at once. I want you to come and live with me. Your daughter Anne."<br><br>"You asked for the looking-glass, Madame," Aline patiently reminded her.<br><br>Mrs. Clephane took the proffered glass, stared into it with eyes at first unseeing, and then gradually made out the reflection of her radiant irrepressible hair, a new smile on her lips, the first streak of gray on her temples, and the first tears -- oh, she couldn't remember for how long -- running down over her transfigured face.<br><br>"Aline --" The maid was watching her with narrowed eyes. "The Rachel powder, please --"<br><br>Suddenly she dropped the glass and the powderpuff, buried her face in her hands, and sobbed.<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 1986 by Louis Auchincloss</p><h2>Theories of Development: Concepts and Applications (International Student Edition)</h2><p>The result of extensive scholarship and consultation with leading scholars, this text introduces students to twenty-four theorists and compares and contrasts their theories on how we develop as individuals.

With his wife and two young children hidden on board, Smalls and a small crew ran a gauntlet of heavily armed fortifications in Charleston Harbor and delivered the valuable vessel and the massive guns it carried to nearby Union forces. To be unsuccessful was a death sentence for all. Smalls&#x2019; courageous and ingenious act freed him and his family from slavery and immediately made him a Union hero while simultaneously challenging much of the country&#x2019;s view of what African Americans were willing to do to gain their freedom. </p><p> After his escape, Smalls served in numerous naval campaigns off Charleston as a civilian boat pilot and eventually became the first black captain of an Army ship. In a particularly poignant moment Smalls even bought the home that he and his mother had once served in as house slaves.</p><p><i>Be Free or Die</i> is a compelling narrative that illuminates Robert Smalls&#x2019; amazing journey from slave to Union hero and ultimately United States Congressman.

G. Jung, especially Jungian dream interpretation. Covering Fellini's entire career, the book links his mature accomplishments to his first employment as a cartoonist, gagman, and sketch-artist during the Fascist era and his development as a leading neo-realist scriptwriter. Peter Bondanella thoroughly explores key Fellinian themes to reveal the director's growth not only as an artistic master of the visual image but also as an astute interpreter of culture and politics. Throughout the book Bondanella draws on a new archive of several dozen manuscripts, obtained from Fellini and his scriptwriters. These previously unexamined documents allow a comprehensive treatment of Fellini's important part in the rise of Italian neorealism and the even more decisive role that he played in the evolution of Italian cinema beyond neorealism in the 1950s. By probing Fellini's recurring themes, Bondanella reinterprets the visual qualities of the director's body of work--and also discloses in the films a critical and intellectual vitality often hidden by Fellini's reputation as a storyteller and entertainer. After two chapters on Fellini's precinematic career, the book covers all the films to date in analytical chapters arranged by topic: Fellini and his growth beyond his neorealist apprenticeship, dreams and metacinema, literature and cinema, Fellini and politics, Fellini and the image of women, and La voce della luna and the cinema of poetry.</p></p><p>This major artistic biography of Federico Fellini shows how his exuberant imagination has been shaped by popular culture, literature, and his encounter with the ideas of Carl Jung, especially Jungian dream interpretation.

Providing insight into today's headlines, Roads to Dominion answers this question with a compelling and thorough look at the broad range of right-wing movements in this country. Based on research that draws extensively from primary source literature, Sara Diamond traces the development of four types of right-wing movements over the past 50 years\m-\the anticommunist conservative movement, the racist Right, the Christian Right, and the neoconservatives\m-\and provides an astute historical analysis of each. Maintaining a nonjudgmental tone throughout the book, she explores these movements' roles within the political process and examines their relationships with administrations in power.<br><br>The book opens with the immediate aftermath of World War II and the onset of the Cold War, when the anticommunist policies of the United States government encouraged the growth of right-wing movements. Continuing through the 1960s and beyond, chapters examine the influence of right-wing groups within the Republican Party and the rise of white supremacist groups in response to the gains of the civil rights movement. We see the transformation of the neoconservatives, from a small band of Cold War liberal intellectuals into a bastion of support for Reagan era foreign policy. The book traces the development of the Christian Right, from its early activity during the Cold War period straight through to its heyday as a powerful grassroots movement during the 1980s and 1990s. Throughout the book, Diamond explains the Right's fifty-year quest for power. She shows how we can understand and even predict the Right's influence on day-to-day policymaking in the United States by observing some consistent patterns in the Right's relationships with political elites and government agencies. In some predictable ways, the Right engages in both conflict and collaboration with state institutions.<br></p><p>Sara Diamond, PhD, a leading authority on right-wing movements in the United States, holds a doctorate in sociology from the University of California.

Robert Quinn shows how to defy convention and create organizations where people feel fully engaged and continually rewarded, where both individually and collectively they flourish and exceed expectations.<br><br> The problem is that leaders are following a negative and constraining &#x201c;mental map&#x201d; that insists organizations must be rigid, top-down hierarchies and that the people in them are driven mainly by self-interest and fear. But leaders can adopt a different mental map, one where organizations are networks of fluid, evolving relationships and where people are motivated by a desire to grow, learn, and serve a larger goal. Using dozens of memorable stories, Quinn describes specific actions leaders can take to facilitate the emergence of this organizational culture&#x2014;helping people gain a sense of purpose, engage in authentic conversations, see new possibilities, and sacrifice for the common good. <br><br> The book includes the Positive Organization Generator, a tool that provides 100 real-life practices from positive organizations and helps you reinvent them to fit your specific needs. With the POG you can identify and implement the practices that will have the greatest impact on your organization. <br><br> At its heart, the book helps leaders to see new possibilities that lie within&nbsp;the acknowledged&nbsp;realities of organizational life. It provides five keys for learning to be "bilingual"--speaking the conventional language of business as well as the language of the positive&nbsp;organization.&nbsp; When leaders can do this, they are able to make real and lasting change.</p><p>Continuing his groundbreaking work in Positive Organizational Scholarship, Robert Quinn (bestselling author of Deep Change) offers a clear path and concrete actions for creating extraordinarily high-performing organizational cultures.Robert E.

He received a doctorate in philosophy and religion from Columbia University and is the author of Coming Home: The Experience of Enlightenment in Sacred Traditions and Heart of the Koran.A remarkable portrait of a most remarkable spiritual teacher. Though little known in the West, Ramakrishna (1836-86) is generally revered in India as a direct incarnation of God, similar in some ways to Christ. Rather than write a standard biography of this Hindu mystic who embraced and, reportedly, embodied the essence of all major world religions--a biography like Richard Schiffman's Sri Ramakrishna (1989)--Hixon (Coming Home, 1978) here attempts a more daunting task: to re-create the experience of observing, over the course of years, a man who ``has attained the goal of spiritual evolution.'' To do this, the author draws on numerous eyewitness accounts of the sage, smoothly blending them into the voice of a disciple who observes his ``Master'' lecturing, conversing, playing, singing, dancing, and slipping into profound mystical ecstasies. There is no skepticism in this devotional telling but, rather, a pervasive sense of wonder and even rapture that Hixon makes concrete through tight physical detail, as in this deathbed scene: ``Ramakrishna's charming smile and the fresh white cloth around his waist shine in the flickering lamplight. His honey-colored skin, dulled by illness, seems to regain its extraordinary luster....The room is being filled with light....It is like a lightning flash, prolonged for several minutes. The pressure is unbearable....'' There is also much inspired exposition by Ramakrishna of religious principles and practices, making this account of great interest to those spiritually inclined but occasionally a tough go for those more interested in Ramakrishna's incandescent character than in his teachings. You don't have to share Hixon's conviction in order to appreciate his achievement in evoking--artfully and with considerable emotional power--what it might be like to encounter, as Ramakrishna put it, ``a human emanation of Divine Reality.'' -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Looking at the region&#x2019;s current water crisis from the perspective of its climate history, the authors ask the central question of what is &#x201c;normal&#x201d; climate for the West, and whether the relatively benign climate of the past century will continue into the future.<br><br><i>The West without Water</i> merges climate and paleoclimate research from a wide variety of sources as it introduces readers to key discoveries in cracking the secrets of the region&#x2019;s climatic past. It demonstrates that extended droughts and catastrophic floods have plagued the West with regularity over the past two millennia and recounts the most disastrous flood in the history of California and the West, which occurred in 1861&#x2013;62. The authors show that, while the West may have temporarily buffered itself from such harsh climatic swings by creating artificial environments and human landscapes, our modern civilization may be ill-prepared for the future climate changes that are predicted to beset the region. They warn that it is time to face the realities of the past and prepare for a future in which fresh water may be less reliable.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Ingram and Malamud-Roam&#x2019;s book presents a remarkable mix of science, paleoclimatology, history, and poetic writing, telling the story of water in the West and how it is intimately tied to the Earth&#x2019;s varying climate. The authors vividly remind us of two things: first, society ignores the lessons of past climatic extremes at our peril, and second, we can no longer assume that the past is a reliable guide to the future, as human influence over the climate grows. The climate is changing, and our relationship to it must change as well.

Now, in this beautifully illustrated, oversized volume--boasting over 250 pictures, 30 in full color--eleven leading authorities chronicle the full sweep of this stunning musical genre, ranging from the earliest known works to such recent experimental efforts as Robert Wilson and Philip Glass's <em>Einstein on the Beach</em>.<br> The contributors--including such noted opera critics as William Ashbrook, Paul Griffiths, and Barry Millington--provide superb coverage of all the major periods. We read of the remarkable success of opera in republican Venice, where by 1650 some fifty operas had been performed, including masterworks by Monteverdi, the giant of the era. We learn of opera seria--which within the world of eighteenth-century Italian opera was the summit of prestige--and opera buffa, most noted today for three major works by Mozart: <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em>, <em>Don Giovanni</em>, and <em>Cosi Fan Tutti</em>. We explore the peak of opera's popularity in nineteenth-century France, Italy, and Germany, with astute commentary on such major composers as Berlioz, Bizet, Rossini, Donizetti, and especially Wagner and Verdi. And we examine the remarkably diverse works of our own century, from Strauss's <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em> and Alban Berg's <em>Wozzeck</em> to Benjamin Britten's <em>Death in Venice</em> and John Adams's <em>Nixon in China</em>. Throughout, the contributors illuminate how opera often reflects the cultural concerns of the age, how it is part of the social fabric, and in three fascinating sections on staging, singers, and the social climate, they give us a look behind the scenes as well as a feel for what opera was like in the past. We discover, for instance, that before the late nineteenth century, patrons were not expected to arrive on time, sit still, keep quiet, concentrate on the stage action, or stay to the end (Wagner put an end to this practice by darkening the theatre). Not least important are the numerous illustrations in the book, which highlight the richly visual nature of opera, the manner in which it communicates so vividly through staging and costume. Exhaustively researched and informatively captioned, these striking pictures offer an immediacy with the past that both enriches and complements the narrative.<br> Nowhere does the rich panoply of opera history unfold more grandly than in this volume. Authoritative, vividly written, and exquisitely designed, it will be treasured by everyone who loves opera.</p><p><br><strong>Roger Parker</strong> is Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He has written extensively on Verdi, nineteenth-century Italian opera, and is the founding co-editor of the <em>Cambridge Opera Journal</em>.<br>There are few one-volume histories of opera available, and none includes the up-to-date information contained here. Nine leading authorities (all contributors to The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, 4 vols., LJ 2/15/93) provide insightful chapters on periods in opera history, from a thorough account of opera in the 17th century through the works of present-day composers such as Philip Glass and John Adams. Because it is intended for the general reader, this work has no musical examples or footnotes and is therefore less useful as a reference source than other works such as Donald J. Grout's A Short History of Opera (Columbia Univ. Pr., 1965. 2d ed.). The chapters are not organized in a strictly chronological format but are built around a series of concepts or arguments, presented with a wealth of supporting information, making the index (not seen) essential to finding answers to specific questions. For both the casual and informed reader, however, the more than 250 illustrations-many rare, and all appearing with detailed captions-will be of particular interest. There is also a notable chapter on staging, and the fascinating opera trivia (from traffic jams and ticket scalpers to a history of lavatories) found in John Rosselli's chapter, "Opera as Social Occasion," will hold readers' attention. Attractively priced, this unique reader is highly recommended for both academic and public libraries.<br><i>Kate McCaffrey, Onondaga Cty.

Kunstler&#x2019;s shocking vision of our post-oil future caught the attention of environmentalists and business leaders alike, and stimulated widespread discussion about our dependence on fossil fuels and our dysfunctional financial and government institutions. Kunstler has since been profiled in The New Yorker and invited to speak at TED. In <i>Too Much Magic</i>, Kunstler evaluates what has changed in the last seven years and shows us that, in a post-financial-crisis world, his ideas are more relevant than ever.<br><br> Too Much Magic&#x201d; is what Kunstler sees in the bright visions of a future world dreamed up by optimistic souls who believe technology will solve all our problems. Their visions remind him of the flying cars and robot maids that were the dominant images of the future in the 1950s. Kunstler&#x2019;s image of the future is much more sober. With vision, clarity of thought, and a pragmatic worldview, Kunstler argues that the time for magical thinking and hoping for miracles is over, and the time to begin preparing for the long emergency has begun.<br></p><p>James Howard Kunstler was born in New York City in 1948.

In Kunstler&#x2019;s view, this is a childish fantasy. . . . Kunstler believes that we are living on borrowed time our banking and political systems are corrupt, our fossil fuel reserves are dwindling, the seas are rising but we&#x2019;re still partying like it&#x2019;s 1959.&#x201d; Jeff Goodell, <i>Rolling Stone</i><br><br> Kunstler . . . delivers a cold slap to the fantasists who believe technology will save us. . . . A sharp demand to disenthrall ourselves.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> [Kunstler&#x2019;s] views are not a popular or welcomed position in America today. . . But his views about the future appear more and more to be being validated by current events. . . . In his new book, <i>Too Much Magic</i>, Kunstler updates his prior writings on Peak Oil stating how Americans&#x2019; long-held, ill-conceived belief that new technologies can always conquer our problems is leading us into a period of great denial and subsequent anger. . . . His new book and his prior works are worth the read. Throughout his work, he offers the surprisingly positive idea an energy limited future might well bring about many of the the things the nation at large claims to crave.&#x201d; Examiner.com<br><br> James Howard Kunstler describes himself as an all-purpose writer&#x2019;, and boy can he write . . . [he makes his subjects] interesting and useful to the reader, without talking down to, or boring us. . . . Too Much Magic, like The Long Emergency, is destined to become a Peak Oil classic.&#x201d; Kathy McMahon, Energy Bulletin<br><br> I highly encourage you to read the book, and to check out Kunstler&#x2019;s other works.&#x201d; Urban Times<br><br> Kunstler&#x2019;s writing is remarkably lucid, readable, incisive, accurate, and telling, making it the absolute non-fiction page turner of 2012 . . . It is a MUST READ! . . . The definitive book for anyone who is done with fairy tales and who is ready to meet the world where it really is.&#x201d; Transition Voice<br><br> Kunstler is a big fan of paleo-futurism. In 2001, there was no space odyssey. We are almost to 2015 and it is unlikely there will be any of Doc Brown&#x2019;s flying cars or hoverboards. The future of 2000 has not lived up to the hype of those imagining the future in 1950.&#x201d; Occidental Dissent<br><br> Kunstler delivers a sobering message about what a post-oil society might look like and how we got ourselves into this situation . . . Too Much Magic is both a history lesson and a warning. The warning concerns how we as a society will have to deal with a world where cheap, plentiful oil is a thing of the past. The history lesson is all about how we came to live in such an oil-dependent society bent on expanding its suburbs to infinity . . . [A] rather sobering (and, at times, frightening) book that may keep you up nights . . . If nothing else, reading this book will get you thinking about serious societal issues, and you will likely learn something as well.&#x201d; KAZI Book Review<br><br> With characteristic curmudgeonly enthusiasm, Kunstler brilliantly if belligerently shows us what a pickle we&#x2019;re in and how inept we are at dealing with it.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> Anyone who has read Kunstler&#x2019;s previous work will no doubt already be guessing that Too Much Magic is lively, curmudgeonly, and highly readable, as indeed it is.&#x201d; The Archdruid Report<br><br> American journalist and novelist James Howard Kunstler has become widely known in urban planning and energy circles for his articulate and acerbic observations on contemporary American society and its sundry addictions, delusions and dysfunctions . . . a sharp critic of energy-sucking, big-box landscapes.&#x201d; Winnipeg Free Press<br><br> Whether your comfort beverage of choice is herbal tea or single malt Scotch, you'd be well advised to lay in a large store before settling down with James Howard Kunstler's disturbing portrait of the U.S.'s impending decline, Too Much Magic. . . . Kunstler methodically skewers what he asserts is the misguided thinking of people like Ray Kurzweil (<i>The Singularity Is Near</i>) who reassure us we can somehow craft benign, inexpensive fixes that will permit us to continue in a lifestyle roughly resembling the one we enjoy today. . . . a disturbing picture of the decline of American society, as our current lifestyle collapses in upon itself.&#x201d; Shelf Awareness<br><br> Kunstler is refreshingly uninterested in spinning a bad situation. He is willing not only to read the data about resources without illusion but also to assess the state of the culture without the triumphalism so common in the affluent world. . . . He&#x2019;s not claiming a crystal ball and isn&#x2019;t interested in specific prediction, nor does he have a tidy list of solutions. Instead, he points out that we can&#x2019;t expect to tackle problems until we recognize them."

Having written groundbreaking studies of the New Testament and a standard work on Paul's theology, Dunn here turns his pen to the rise of Christianity itself. <i>Jesus Remembered</i> is the first installment in what will be a monumental three-volume history of the first 120 years of the faith.<br><br>Focusing on Jesus, this first volume has several distinct features. It garners the lessons to be learned from the "quest for the historical Jesus" and meets the hermeneutical challenges to a historical and theological assessment of the Jesus tradition. It provides a fresh perspective both on the impact made by Jesus and on the traditions about Jesus as oral tradition -- hence the title "Jesus Remembered." And it offers a fresh analysis of the details of that tradition, emphasizing its characteristic (rather than dissimilar) features. Noteworthy too are Dunn's treatments of the source question (particularly Q and the noncanonical Gospels) and of Jesus the Jew in his Galilean context.<br><br>In his detailed analysis of the Baptist tradition, the kingdom motif, the call to and character of discipleship, what Jesus' audiences thought of him, what he thought of himself, why he was crucified, and how and why belief in Jesus' resurrection began, Dunn engages wholeheartedly in the contemporary debate, providing many important insights and offering a thoroughly convincing account of how Jesus was remembered from the first, and why.<br><br>Written with peerless scholarly acumen yet accessible to a wide range of readers, Dunn's <i>Jesus Remembered</i>, together with its successor volumes, will be a <i>sine qua non</i> for all students of Christianity's beginnings.</p><p><b>James D. G. Dunn</b>&nbsp;is Lightfoot Professor Emeritus of Divinity at Durham University and one of the foremost New Testament scholars in the world today. His many other books include the magisterial&nbsp;<i>Christianity in the Making</i>&nbsp;trilogy and&nbsp;<i>The Theology of Paul the Apostle.</i><b>Homiletic</b><br> "This tome takes its place among the equally voluminous and deep contributions of scholars like Crossan, John Meier, N.T. Wright, and Walter Wink. . . Most important for preachers is the way Dunn interprets the words and deeds of Jesus and stories of his life as an unfolding, living tradition of interpretation. It helps us to understand our own work as part of that unfolding, living tradition. . . ."<br><br><b><i>Toronto Journal of Theology</i></b><br> "Dunn is to be commended for his challenging and insightful work. It must be read by all who are interested in the field, and it is destined to become a significant conversation partner in future discussions of the historical Jesus."<br><br><b>Christopher Tuckett</b><br> "A magnificent achievement.&nbsp;<i>Jesus Remembered</i>&nbsp;is massively thorough and wide-ranging, innovative in its stress on orality, at times provocative, yet also immensely readable and clear. James Dunn's book will undoubtedly shape Jesus study for the next generation and more. This is a 'must' for all those engaged in study of Jesus at whatever level."<br><br><b>Dale C. Allison Jr.</b><br> "This is not just one more book on Jesus but rather an esteemed scholar's wide-ranging presentation of conclusions arrived at over a lifetime of informed, critical reflection. It is full of good sense and much learning. As always, James Dunn's work is characterized not only by a genuine familiarity with Jesus' first-century Jewish world but also by an unsurpassed knowledge of the vast secondary literature. Especially suggestive is the consistent appeal to continuing oral tradition, which often appears justified."<br><br><b>Samuel Byrskog</b><br> "In this study one of the most prolific New Testament scholars of today presents an impressive new approach to the old 'quest for the historical Jesus.' James Dunn's central thesis that a hermeneutically informed dialogue with the ancient texts will legitimate an account of the impact of Jesus as it was remembered by his earliest followers convincingly places the oral character of the Jesus tradition at the very center of attention. The book should not only help scholarship to free itself from the prevailing literary paradigm, but also promote a healthy balance between positivistic optimism and postmodern relativism in the search for the so-called historical Jesus. "<br><br><b>John P. Meier</b><br> "For decades James D. G. Dunn has been a leader in serious and balanced study of both christology and history-of-Jesus research. I have profited greatly from his many books and articles, and I am delighted to read this massive distillation of his many years of reflection and publication on the historical Jesus. I highly recommend&nbsp;<i>Jesus Remembered</i>&nbsp;to all those interested in a thoughtful and methodologically sophisticated approach to the major questions that plague and stimulate historical-Jesus research today."<br><br><b>Mark Allan Powell</b><br> "Any serious student of the historical Jesus will want to become familiar with James Dunn's thorough and somewhat unique treatment of the subject. Dunn focuses his attention on characteristic features in the early traditions concerning Jesus in order to determine the impact that the latter had on his first followers. The portrait that emerges is both convincing and thought-provoking ? an indispensable contribution to an ongoing quest to comprehend the significance of Jesus for the history of Christianity and for modern civilization."<br><br><b>Jonathan L. Reed</b><br> "<i>Jesus Remembered</i>&nbsp;provides a fresh and thorough look at Christian origins that is provocative and at the same time judicious in its assessments. James Dunn is equally at home in the history of scholarship, in the details of the Gospels, in the array of nonbiblical sources, and in the archaeology of Jesus' world, and he weaves these into a coherent and credible account of the Jesus traditions.<i>Jesus Remembered</i>&nbsp;is absolutely essential reading for scholars and pastors, and Dunn's clarity and fluid style make complex issues accessible to undergraduate students and laypersons as well."</p><h2>Derailed: Five Lessons Learned from Catastrophic Failures of Leadership</h2><p>Vibrant stories of well-known execs who failed spectacularly as senior executives of major corporations.

Poe: Mournful and Never-Ending Remembrance</h2><p>A look at the life and work of Edgar Allan Poe traces his life from his childhood as an adopted son, to his experiences in the U.S. Army, to his career as a journalist, editor, and writer, and discusses his influence on literature</p><p>Kenneth Silverman is a professor of English, a graduate advisor in American Civilization, co-director of The Biography Seminar at New York University, and an amateur magician. He lives in New York City.An outstanding new biography by Silverman, whose The Life and Times of Cotton Mather (1983) won a Pulitzer Prize. Poe's stature as one of the ``founding fathers'' of American letters is so well established that one would be hard-pressed to find anyone educated in this country without some familiarity with his work. Known primarily as a poet and storyteller, he was in fact, as Silverman details, one of the most prolific literary journalists in American history, one whose extensive body of reviews and criticism has yet to be collected fully. A key strength of Silverman's biography is that it recognizes one of the truly distinctive aspects of Poe's character--that he belonged to the first generation of professional (as opposed to amateur) writers in America--and examines both his life and his art in this light. The great tragedies of Poe's life--his miserable childhood, his doomed marriage, the alcoholism--are well known already, but Silverman is able to highlight how many aspects of Poe's despair were the simple outgrowth of his vocation: the constant uprootings, the grinding poverty, the overexertions and tensions of the literary hack. The exegesis of Poe's writing is intelligent, realistic, and relates in a believable way to the circumstances of the writer's life. Moreover, Silverman's meticulous appendices and notes should prove invaluable to future scholars. A remarkable success: the first major biography of Poe in over 50 years, written with careful skill and great style.

Around 1980, he turned to sketching and painting to keep his mind occupied with something when he wasn't playing music. This hobby quickly turned into a serious passion, and Davis approached it with the same obsessive creativity he applied to music. The result is an impressive archive of unique and evocative visual work showcasing the varied skills of this legendary artist. Throughout the 1980s, Davis studied regularly with New York painter Jo Gelbard, developing a distinct graphic style. Incorporating bright colors and geometric shapes, his art is reminiscent of work by Pablo Picasso as well as African tribal art, the historical influences he cited during occasional interviews on the subject. Author Scott Gutterman sat down with Miles Davis himself before his death in 1991 and the artist&#x2019;s own commentary accompanies this remarkable showcase of his work. Sadly, very few of his pieces were exhibited during Miles Davis&#x2019;s lifetime. Over the last two decades, the Estate of Miles Davis has worked with gallery owners and private parties to assemble a comprehensive collection of the musician&#x2019;s artwork. Many celebrities are among the most adamant collectors, including Quincy Jones, who offers a foreword to the book. This long-overdue celebration is a treasure for art lovers as well as music aficionados who will appreciate the window into the life of this creative genius.</p><p>Scott Gutterman writes about music and art for Vogue, Artforum, The New Yorker, GQ, and other publications.

She lives in Henderson, NV.Attentive followers of jazz master Miles Davis will know that his visual art appeared on an album cover now and then when album covers mattered. But few are aware of the extent of Davis&#x2019; commitment to sketching and painting. Beginning in 1980, when he was 54, until his death in 1991, Davis made art as much a part of his life as music, bringing to it the same inner-directed quest for fresh expression. Not that one can&#x2019;t detect elements of inspiration in this gorgeous volume of sharp and saturated colorplates, namely Davis&#x2019; responses to Kandinsky, Basquiat, Picasso, and African tribal art. His subjects include highly stylized and powerful female figures, funky characters he called his &#x201c;robots,&#x201d; and totempole faces. A bold and skilled colorist, Davis kept everything in motion in his vibrant, dynamic, lushly textured compositions. Reflections by Davis&#x2019; nephew and band member Vince Wilburn Jr. and two of Davis&#x2019; children and a 1991 interview with music and art writer Scott Gutterman round out this exhilarating volume of dazzling and affecting testimony to Davis&#x2019; many-faceted creativity. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>The Youngest Drover: A True Story About Growing Up on a Cattle Drive</h2><p>Recounts the experiences of the author&#39;s father on a cattle drive from Raymond, Alberta, to Sweetwater, Montana, in the winter of 1923</p><p>Gr. 5^-9. Based on the experiences of Carter's father and reading like a novel, this coming-of-age narrative recounts the true story of 15-year-old Henry, who participated in a winter cattle drive from Raymond, Alberta, to Sweetwater, Montana, in 1923. When a severe drought and an early winter leave prairie grasses too short to feed the stock through the winter, local ranchers decide to thin the herds and cut their losses. Nine men and Henry accompany nearly 3,000 head of cattle through blizzards and cold to Sweetwater, where Henry and three others continue with the herd by rail to the Chicago stockyards. The contrasts between life in the big city and on the ranch do not escape Henry's notice, and he returns home both enlightened and matured by his travels. Adventure enthusiasts will appreciate the author's attention to characters and local color. <i>Kay Weisman</i></p><h2>Dora&#39;s Perfect Pumpkin (Ready-To-Read Dora the Explorer - Level 1) (Dora the Explorer Ready-to-Read)</h2><p>Dora and Boots need to find the perfect pumpkin to make a pie with <i>Abuela</i>!

But, like many other things the masses do, that&#x2019;s not Lavelle&#x2019;s style. <i>Urban Archaeology</i>, in a way, combines most of the items above in one amazing book...focusing just as much on the artwork, photos, and history as it does on the interesting text found within its pages. <i>Urban Archaeology</i> is arranged in a very artistic way...The artwork is stunning. I would catch myself just staring at pages of record sleeves and concepts, wondering why I hadn&#x2019;t seen most of it before. The beauty of what was created for just over two decades at Mo&#x2019;Wax is personified in <i>Urban Archaeology</i> thanks to the cleverly arranged book that includes pages of strong visuals, foldout galleries, collections of old photos, and concept artwork I wish I had in my living room.

Less well known are his works on paper: he held onto most of these, and they were unavailable and largely unknown during his lifetime and during the long years of litigation that followed his death. Now the finest of them can at last be seen. Mark Rothko: Works on Paper presents the intimate legacy of a giant of modern art. As author Bonnie Clearwater writes,With the symmetry, tidy execution, and minimal gesture, the small works on paper often seem to be more quintessential Rothko than many of his canvases.

In this engaging fifth book in the Young Underground series, Peter, Elise, and Henrik are surprised to see Nazis still lurking in their hometown of Helsingx9a r, Denmark, weeks after the Germans have surrendered. These Nazis, the children discover, are retrieving treasure from a recently sunken ship. The children's sleuthing leads them into danger when they become trapped aboard one of the last remaining German U-boats. The author's firm narrative pacing and descriptive immediacy create a high level of suspense as he describes how a U.S. destroyer tracks and nearly sinks the submarine as it heads to South America. Ultimately, Peter and Henrik save the day after Peter miraculously manages to send a signal to the destroyer. Disappointingly, Elise is generally relegated to a supporting role, as she is in the other books in the series. She deserves more. In spite of that shortcoming, this historical thriller offers a vivid picture of the times, a high sense of adventure, and examples of young people who endure serious tests of their faith. <i>Shelley Townsend-Hudson</i></p><h2>Unpleasantness At The Bellona Club</h2><p>Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club</p><p>Dorothy L Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893, and was both a classical scholar and a graduate in modern languages.

The timing means half a million pounds to someone. Ian Carmichael is Peter Wimsey. With perfect timing and vocal inflection, he ekes every bit of humor out of Wimsey that is possible to get while still maintaining the detective's effete, ever so aristocratic intelligence.

When a transition takes place there is greater risk of something radically going wrong than is the case in our normal daily routines. In my professional career, I have observed many such disasters that can affect organizations negatively for years, if not decades. <p> It appears that our culture is now heading into a time of significant transition and some would even say we are headed straight into a perfect storm that will radically affect Christ-centered organizations' ability to function. In a culture moving further and further from values grounded in biblical truth and morality, the "greatest" generation is moving off the scene; the massive baby boomer group (made up of many current CEOs and board members) is rapidly sliding into retirement; and a smaller pool of younger prospective leaders (often with different values) are coming up the ranks to take their place. Smooth and successful CEO selection, transition and development are key elements in relation to these changes. </p><p> For more than 30 years ECFA has been committed to helping Christ-centered organizations earn the public's trust by developing and maintaining standards of accountability that convey God-honoring ethical practices. As an accreditation agency dedicated to encouraging Christian ministries to earn the public's trust, ECFA has established standards that encompass financial accountability, fundraising, and board governance. One of the core elements of ECFA's ministry is providing ongoing capacity building for Christ-centered organizations in these three areas. </p><p> As the distance between the secular models of leadership and a Christian worldview increases, the need for successful transitions and training from a Christ-centered perspective intensifies. The secular perspectives are plentiful. However, little is available that pulls together professional excellence and spiritual discernment based on a biblical worldview. What is considered "Christian" is often a two-tiered view of leadership in which the Christian faith is simply overlaid on a secular premise. We believe that a Christ-centered ministry's ability to successfully manage the CEO selection, transition and development will strengthen the cause of Christ and significantly improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of many organizations. </p><p> If an executive officer is poorly selected, poorly trained and operating ineffectively, the weakness can derail an otherwise powerful force for the Kingdom of God. To meet these challenges, it is essential to increase organizational capacity at Christ-centered ministries by providing their CEOs and board members with the practical skills to lead in tumultuous times. </p><p> Because board governance and CEO training are so vital to the future health of Christ-centered organizations, I am delighted for ECFA to offer this book that draws on the rich experience, knowledge and spiritual insight of my friend, David McKenna. Over a period of more than 50 years, he served as president of three Christian institutions of higher education, chair of the board of two Christian universities, was founding chair of Christian College Consortium, board member of a wide range of Christ-centered organizations, and consultant for presidential searches, assessment and board development with a wide range of organizations. </p><p> My prayer is that God will use this book mightily as a tool to strengthen Christ-centered organizations in their efforts to fulfill the Great Commission. </p><p> Dan Busby President ECFA</p></p><p>Dr. David McKenna has served for more than 50 years in Christian higher education, including 33 years as a college, university and seminary president. <p> At Spring Arbor College (now University), he developed a junior college into a four-year Christian liberal arts college; at Seattle Pacific University, he led the transition from a four-year college to university status; at Asbury Theological Seminary, he gained and guided the largest grant ever given in American history to a free standing graduate school of theology. In 1994, Dr, McKenna retired as President Emeritus of Asbury Theological Seminary to write, speak and consult on subjects related to leadership in Christian higher education and ministry. In 2003, he retired as Chair Emeritus, Board of Trustees, Spring Arbor University. </p><p> Dr. McKenna holds a B.A. degree in History from Western Michigan University, Master of Divinity from Asbury Theological Seminary, and an M.A. in Counseling Psychology and Ph.

If we fail, the future is bleak. David McKenna shows us the way. <p> We are at the beginning of a major leadership change in evangelical organizations from megachurches to universities to parachurch organizations. Some haven't chosen a top leader indecades. Others are looking for successors to founders. Dave McKenna brings stellar experience to coaching boards and selection committees to success in succession. --Leith Anderson, President, National Association of Evangelicals<br><br>Does the world truly need another leadership book? Yes, if that book is Stewards of a Sacred Trust. Building off a sense of Kingdom-calling that exists (or should exist!) between a board and a CEO and the ministry she or he leads, author and top executive and board veteran David McKenna delivers an extremely practical and powerfully challenging account detailing the God-led selection, transitioning, and development of leadership within the Christian context. The book compellingly charges all boards (and all would-be board members) to carefully weigh and work out the significance of their calling. And it offers deep hope and encouragement to any ministry leader who desires a leader whose commitment to her or his success is built upon prayer and their own sweat equity. A much-needed read especially in these challenging times. --Harold B. Smith, President, Christianity Today International<br><br>David McKenna has produced an exceedingly useful book to help all who seriously want to be extraordinary stewards of the sacred trust through trusteeship on a nonprofit board!

The rolling hills were a brilliant emerald green, which would fade once the weather grew warmer, and get dry and brittle in the summer heat. But for now, everything was fresh and new, and the vineyards stretched for miles across the Valley. Visitors compared it to Tuscany in Italy, and some to France.<br><br>She had come there for the first time with Christophe twenty-ï¿½four years before, while she was getting her master&#x2019;s in business administration at Stanford, and he was taking graduate classes in oenology and viticulture. He had painstakingly explained to her that oenology was everything about making wine, and viticulture was about planting and growing grapes. His family had been making famous wines in Bordeaux for centuries, where his father and uncles ran the family winery and vineyards, but his dream had been to come to California and learn more about the wines and vineyards and vintners in the Napa Valley. He had confided to Joy that he wanted a small winery of his own. It had just been a vague hope at first, a fantasy he would never indulge. He assumed that he would go back to France to follow the expected path, like his ancestors and relatives before him. But he fell in love with California and life in the States, and became more and more passionate about the vineyards in the Napa Valley during his year at Stanford. His father&#x2019;s sudden death at an early age, while Christophe was at Stanford, left him with an unexpected windfall of money to invest, and suddenly made establishing his own winery in the United States not only enticing but feasible. After they both finished graduate school in June, he had gone home to France in the summer to explain it to his family, and came back in the fall to bring his plan to fruition.<br><br>Joy was the most exciting woman he&#x2019;d ever met, with a diversity of talents. She had a natural gift for anything related to business or finance. And at the same time, she was a painter and artist, had taken classes in Italy over several summers, and could easily have pursued a career in art. She struggled with the decision for a while in college. Her teachers in Italy had encouraged her to forget business. But in the end, her more practical side won out, and she kept her painting as a hobby she loved, and focused on her entrepreneurial goals. She had an instinctive sense of what the best deals were, and wanted to work in one of the Silicon Valley high-ï¿½tech investment firms, before starting her own venture capital firm one day. She talked to Christophe about it constantly.<br><br>She knew nothing about wine when they met, and he taught her during the year they spent together. She wasn&#x2019;t really interested in vineyards and wineries, but the way he explained it all brought it to life for her and made it seem almost magical. He loved making wine as much as she did painting, or her fascination with creative investments. Agriculture seemed like risky business to her. So much could go wrong, an early frost, a late harvest, too much rain, or too little. But Christophe said that was part of the mystery and beauty of it, and when all the necessary ingredients came together, you wound up with an unforgettable vintage that people would talk about forever, that could turn an ordinary wine into a remarkable gift of nature.<br><br>When she visited the Napa Valley with him, again and again, she began to understand that making wine was in his soul and DNA, and having a respected label of his own was the ultimate achievement to him, and what he hoped for. She was twenty-ï¿½five then, and he was twenty-ï¿½six. She had been fortunate to get a job with a legendary venture capital firm right after they graduated and loved what she was doing. And when Christophe came back from France at the end of the summer, looking for land to buy, and vineyards he could replant exactly the way he wanted them, according to everything he had been taught in France, he asked her to go with him. He respected Joy&#x2019;s advice about all the financial aspects of any deal. She helped him buy his first vineyard, and by November, he had bought six, all of them adjoining one another.<br><br>The vines were old, and he knew exactly what he wanted to plant there. He told her he would keep his winery small, but he would have the best pinot noir in the Valley one day, and she believed him. He explained to her about the fine points of the wines they tasted, what was wrong with them and what was right, how they could have been different or better, or should have been. And he introduced her to French wines, and the wine his family made and had exported from Chï¿½teau Lammenais for generations.<br><br>He had bought an additional piece of property on the hill overlooking his vineyards and the Valley, and said he was going to build a small chï¿½teau there. In the meantime, he was living in a cabin with one bedroom and a comfortable living room with a huge fireplace. They spent many a cozy night there on weekends, while he shared his hopes with her, and she explained to him how to make the business side of it work, and how to design his financial plan.<br><br>They spent Christmas together in his cabin, and stood on the small porch in the early mornings, admiring nature at its finest. With his father gone then, and his mother many years before, he didn&#x2019;t want to go back to France for Christmas with his uncles, he wanted to spend it with Joy. She had no family to go home to either. Her mother had died young, of cancer when Joy was fifteen, and her much older father had been devastated and died of grief three years later. She and Christophe created their own world in the place he had brought her to, and he had cooked a remarkable Christmas dinner for her of goose and pheasant, which set off the wines he had chosen to perfection.<br><br>In the spring, he began building his chï¿½teau, just as he said he would. She learned that Christophe was a visionary of sorts, but remarkably he always did what he said he would, and turned his ideas from the abstract to concrete reality. He never lost sight of his goals, and she showed him how to get there. He described what he saw in the future, and she helped him fulfill his dreams. He had beautiful plans for the chï¿½teau.<br><br>He had the stone brought over from France, and said he didn&#x2019;t want anything too imposing or too large. He based the design loosely on his own family&#x2019;s four-ï¿½hundred-ï¿½year-ï¿½old chï¿½teau, and gave the architect countless sketches and photographs of what he had in mind, with the alterations that he felt would work on the property he had chosen, and he was relentless about the proportions. Not too big and not too small. He had picked a hill with beautiful old trees surrounding the clearing where he wanted to build his home. He said he was going to put red rosebushes everywhere, just like they had in France, and laid it all out with a landscape architect, who was thrilled with the project.<br><br>The house was well underway by summer when he asked Joy to marry him. They had dated for well over a year by then. He was constructing his winery amid the vineyards, at the same time he built his chï¿½teau, which was a jewel. They were married at a small ceremony in a nearby church at the end of August, with two of his vineyard workers as their witnesses. They had no real friends in the Valley yet. They had each other, which was more than enough, for a start. They agreed that the rest could come later. They were establishing their life together, and she had great respect for Christophe&#x2019;s passion for the earth and his land. It was in his bones and in his veins and in his heart. The grapes he grew were living beings to him, to be cherished and nourished and protected. And he felt the same way about his wife. He cherished her like a precious gift, and she blossomed and thrived in the warmth of his love, and loved him just as deeply.<br><br>The chï¿½teau wasn&#x2019;t yet complete on the first Christmas they were married, and they were still living in his simple cabin, which suited their quiet life. Joy was three months pregnant by then, and Christophe wanted their home finished in time to bring their first child there when it was born in June. Joy had quit her job in Silicon Valley when they married, since she couldn&#x2019;t commute that far, and she worked hard at helping him set up his winery. She handled the business and he dealt with the vines. Her belly was round and full when they moved into the chï¿½teau in May, just as Christophe had promised. They spent a month there, while she painted beautiful frescoes and murals at night and on the weekends, waiting for their first child to arrive, and she worked in the office of their new winery every day. He had named it after her, and called it Chï¿½teau Joy, which was the perfect description of their life.<br><br>They woke up excited to go to work every day, and had lunch together at the house, to discuss progress and the problems they were solving. He had planted their vines, using all the precepts he had grown up with, and two of his uncles had come to visit them, approved of everything they were doing, and said it would be the best winery in the Napa Valley in twenty years. The vines they had planted were growing well, and the chï¿½teau already felt like home to them. They had furnished it with old French provincial antiques they had found at country auctions and antique stores and picked out everything together.<br><br>The baby arrived as gently and peacefully as the rest of their plans had taken shape over the past two years. They went to the hospital in the morning when Joy told him it was time, shortly after breakfast. They drove down the hill and to the hospital, and by late that afternoon, Joy had a beautiful baby girl in her arms, as Christophe looked at Joy in awe. It had all been so easy and simple and natural. The little girl had her mother&#x2019;s pale blond hair and white skin, and her father&#x2019;s deep blue eyes, from the moment she was born. It was obvious that her eyes would stay blue, since her mother&#x2019;s eyes were blue as well. And her skin was so creamy fair that Christophe said she looked like a flower, and they named her Camille.<br><br>They went home to the chï¿½teau the next day, to begin their life together. And Camille grew up with two adoring parents, in an exquisite small chï¿½teau, amid the beauty of the Napa Valley, looking out over her father&#x2019;s vineyards. And Christophe&#x2019;s uncles&#x2019; prediction proved to be true. Within a few years, he was producing one of the finest pinot noirs in the entire region. Their business was sound, their future secure, they were respected and admired by all the important vintners in the Napa Valley, and many of them sought advice from him. Christophe had years of family history behind him along with his own nearly infallible instincts. His closest friend was Sam Marshall, who owned the largest winery in the Valley. He didn&#x2019;t have Christophe&#x2019;s history or knowledge of French viticulture, but he had an instinctive sense for growing great wines, was brave and innovative, and owned more land than anyone else in the Valley, and Christophe liked exchanging ideas with him.<br><br>His wife, Barbara, and Joy were friends too, and the two couples often spent time together with their children, on weekends. The Marshalls had a little boy who was seven years old when Camille was born. Phillip was fascinated by the baby when the two families had lunch together on Sundays. Christophe would cook a big French meal for them, while he and Sam talked business and the women watched the children. Joy let Phillip hold Camille when she was two weeks old. But most of the time he preferred climbing trees, or running around the fields, picking fruit in the orchards, or riding his bike in their driveway.</p><h2>Wildlife: The Nature Paintings of Carl Brenders</h2><p>Carl Brenders is one of the world's most accomplished nature painters. Specializing in wildlife, Brenders in no way neglects the natural settings in which mammals and birds live. Meticulously realistic, brilliantly observed, and exquisitely composed, his paintings take their place in an artistic tradition that goes back to John James Audubon, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, and Wolfgang Kuhnhert. With his growing reputation, he stands as equal beside such distinguished contemporaries as Roger Tory Peterson, Guy Coheleach, and Robert Bateman.<br>Fifty of Carl Brenders' finest paintings of North American wildlife - deer, wolves, cougars, foxes, squirrels, bears, and many different species of birds - make up this collection of recent work of the highly regarded and extremely successful nature painter. His first retrospective book, it is certain to become a collector's item.<br>Here, along with the fifty full-color reproductions of Brenders' works, are a tantalizing selection of his preliminary sketches. All are accompanied by an introduction and complete captions for the paintings written by the artist himself. Brenders freely discusses his sources of inspiration, describes his field experiences observing and photographing his animal subjects, and shares his own deep convictions about the importance of wildlife preservation and wilderness area conservation. In addition to these texts, the book offers a brief biography, with photographs of the painter, by Dana Cooper, who has written about numerous other contemporary nature artists.</p><p></p><h2>Bog People</h2><p>From time to time workers in bogs throughout Europe accidentally expose the sunken bodies of people who died 2000 or more years ago.

He is the author of over sixty books on a wide array of subjects, and his books have been translated into forty-six languages. He lives in Edinburgh with his wife.In Botswana, home to the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency for the problems of ladies, and others, it is customary&#x2014;one might say <i>very customary</i>&#x2014;to enquire of the people whom you meet whether they have slept well. The answer to that question is almost inevitably that they have indeed slept well, even if they have not, and have spent the night tossing and turning as a result of the nocturnal barking of dogs, the activity of mosquitoes or the prickings of a bad conscience. Of course, mosquitoes may be defeated by nets or sprays, just as dogs may be roundly scolded; a bad conscience, though, is not so easily stifled. If somebody were to invent a spray capable of dealing with an uncomfortable conscience, that person would undoubtedly do rather well&#x2014;but perhaps might not sleep as soundly as before, were he to reflect on the consequences of his invention. Bad consciences, it would appear, are there for a purpose: to make us feel regret over our failings. Should they be silenced, then our entirely human weaknesses, our manifold omissions, would become all the greater&#x2014;and that, as Mma Ramotswe would certainly say, is not a good thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe was fortunate in having an untroubled con-science, and therefore generally enjoyed undisturbed sleep. It was her habit to take to her bed after a final cup of red bush tea at around ten o&#x2019;clock at night. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, her husband and by common consent the finest mechanic in all Botswana, would often retire before her, particularly if he had had a tiring day at work. Mechanics in general sleep well, as do many others whose day is taken up with physically demanding labour. So by the time that Mma Ramotswe went to bed, he might already be lost to this world, his breathing deep and regular, his eyes firmly closed to the bedside light that he would leave for his wife to extinguish.<br>&nbsp;<br>She would not take long to go to sleep, drifting off to thoughts of what had happened that day; to images of herself drinking tea in the office or driving her van on an errand; to the picture of Mma Makutsi sitting upright at her desk, her large glasses catching the light as she held forth on some issue or other. Or to some memory of a long time ago, of her father walking down a dusty road, holding her hand and explaining to her about the ways of cattle&#x2014;a subject that he knew so well. When a wise man dies, there is so much history that is lost: that is what they said, and Mma Ramotswe knew it to be true. Her own father, the late Obed Ramotswe, had taken so much with him, but had also left much behind, so many memories and sayings and observations, that she, his daughter, could now call up and cherish as she waited for the soft arms of sleep to embrace her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe did not remember her dreams for very long once she had woken up. Occasionally, though, an egregiously vivid dream might make such an impression that it lodged in her memory, and that is what happened that morning. It was not in any way a bad dream; nor was it a particularly good dream, the sort of dream that makes one feel as if one has been vouchsafed some great mystical insight; it was, rather, one of those dreams that seems to be a clear warning that something special is about to happen. If a dream involves lottery tickets and numbers, then its meaning is clear enough. This dream was not like that, and yet it left Mma Ramotswe feeling that she had somehow been given advance notice of something out of the ordinary, something important.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this dream she was walking along a path in the stretch of bush immediately behind Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, the building that the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency shared with Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni&#x2019;s garage. She was not sure where she was going, but this did not seem to matter as Mma Ramotswe felt happy just to be walking along it with no great sense of having to reach a destination. And why should one not walk along a path, particularly a comfortable path, without any idea of getting anywhere?<br>&nbsp;<br>She turned a corner and found herself faced with a large acacia tree, its foliage extending out like the canopy of a commodious umbrella. To dream of trees is to . . . to long for trees, and finding herself under the shade of this tree would have been enough to make the dream a satisfactory one. But there was more to it. Underneath the tree, standing in such a position that the mottled shade of the leaves all but obscured his face, was a tall, well-built man. He now stepped forward, held out a hand and said, &#x201c;I have come at last, Mma Ramotswe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And that was the point at which Mma Ramotswe awoke. The encounter with this stranger had not been threatening in any way; there had been nothing in his demeanour that was suggestive of hostility, and she had not felt in the slightest bit anxious. As for what he said, she had simply thought, even if she had not had the time to say it, <i>Yes, it has been a long time.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>For a few minutes after waking, she had lain still in bed, mulling over the dream. Had the man been her father, then the dream would have been easy to understand. She knew that she dreamed of her father from time to time, which was only to be expected, given that not a day went past, not one day, when she did not think of that great and good man, the late Obed Ramotswe. If you think of somebody every day, then you can be sure you will dream of him at night; but it was not him whom she encountered under that acacia tree&#x2014;that was very clear. It was somebody quite different, somebody she sensed was from a long way away. But who could that be? Mma Ramotswe did not really know anybody from a long way away, unless one counted Francistown or Maun, where she knew a number of people. But those towns, although several hundred miles from Gaborone, are both in Botswana, and nowhere in Botswana was the abode of strangers. That was because Botswana, to those who lived there, was home, and familiar, and comfortable, and no place in such a country will seem far away. No, this man under the tree was from somewhere outside the country, and that was unusual and puzzling and would have to be thought about at some length.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I had a very unusual dream,&#x201d; she said to Mma Makutsi as they attended to the morning&#x2019;s mail in the office.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi looked up from the envelope that she was in the process of slitting open. &#x201c;Dreams are always unusual,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;In fact, it is unusual to have a usual dream.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe frowned. She thought that she understood what Mma Makutsi meant but was not quite sure. Her assistant had a habit of making enigmatic remarks, and this, she suspected, was one such remark.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Phuti,&#x201d; Mma Makutsi continued, referring to her new husband, Phuti Radiphuti, &#x201c;Phuti has many dreams, every night. He tells me about them and I explain what they mean.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;He often dreams about furniture.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is because he has a furniture shop,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe said. &#x201c;So perhaps it is not surprising.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is so, Mma,&#x201d; agreed Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;But he can dream about different pieces of furniture.&#x201d; She paused, fixing Mma Ramotswe on the other side of the room with the cautious look of one about to reveal sensitive information. She lowered her voice. &#x201c;Some nights he dreams about beds; other nights he dreams about dining room tables. It is very strange.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked down at her desk. She did not like to discuss the intimate side of anybody&#x2019;s marriage&#x2014;particularly when the marriage was as recent as Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s. She thought of new marriages as being rather like those shy, delicate flowers one sees on the edge of the Kalahari; so small that one might miss them altogether, so vulnerable that a careless step might crush their beauty. Of course, people talked about their dreams without too much embarrassment&#x2014;most dreams, after all, sound inconsequential and silly in the cold light of day&#x2014;but it was different when a wife talked about a husband&#x2019;s dreams, or a husband about a wife&#x2019;s. Dreams occurred in beds, and what occurred in marital beds was not a subject for debate in the office&#x2014;especially if the dream <i>related to </i>beds, as it appeared that some of Phuti Radiphuti&#x2019;s dreams did.<br>&nbsp;<br>But if Mma Ramotswe was reluctant to probe Phuti&#x2019;s dreams too closely, the same was not true of her assistant. The topic had now been broached, and Mma Makutsi pursued it enthusiastically.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There is no doubt about a dream about beds,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;The meaning of that dream is very clear, Mma. It should be very obvious, even to a person who does not know much about dreams, or other things, for that matter.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe said nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi, &#x201c;if a person says <i>I have been dreaming about beds, </i>then you know straight away what the dream means. You can say to them, <i>I know what that dream means. It is very clear.</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked out of the window, which was high, and gave a view from that angle only of a slice of blue; empty blue; blue with no white of cloud; nothingness. &#x201c;Is the meaning of dreams clear, Mma? Do any dreams make sense, or are they just like . . . like clouds in the sky, composed of nothing very much? Maybe they are clouds in our mind, Mma; maybe that is what they are.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi was having none of this. &#x201c;The meaning is often clear,&#x201d; she retorted. &#x201c;I have no difficulty, Mma, in understanding a dream about beds.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe sighed. &#x201c;Well, they do say, don&#x2019;t they, Mma, that men have such things on their minds most of the time. They say that men think only of that, all day. Listen to the way Charlie speaks when he thinks you can&#x2019;t hear him. That shows you what men think about&#x2014;or at least, young men. I do not think that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni has thoughts like that in his head all day. I do not think that, Mma.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was as if Mma Makutsi had not heard her. &#x201c;Yes, Mma. The meaning of a dream about beds is very simple. It means that you are tired. It means that you need more sleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe stared at her assistant for a few moments. Then, with some degree of relief, she smiled. &#x201c;Well, there you have it, Mma. That must be what such a dream means.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;On the other hand,&#x201d; went on Mma Makutsi, &#x201c;a dream about a dining-room table is different. That does not mean that you are tired.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, it does not mean that, Mma. A dream about a dining-room table means that you are hungry. I think that is very obvious.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked first at the teapot, and then at the clock. She would wait, she decided; if one kept bringing forward the time at which one had tea, then the period after teatime would become far too long. Tea had to be taken at the right time; if anything was clear, it was that.<br>&nbsp;<br>She decided to steer the conversation back to her own dream. But just as she was about to do so, Mma Makutsi came up with a further observation on Phuti&#x2019;s dreams. &#x201c;When he said to me one morning that he had dreamed of dining-room tables, I was worried. Was I giving him enough to eat, I wondered?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And what did you decide, Mma?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m giving him enough food. I believe in demand feeding. I think that is what it&#x2019;s called. I always leave some food out in the kitchen so that Phuti can pick up a snack if he feels hungry. There are other women who believe that you should only feed your husband at set times, so that he gets used to it. But I am not one of those women, Mma. I leave food out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe suppressed a grin at the thought of demand feeding for husbands. The conversation, although potentially sensitive, had proved to be more amusing than anything else, and she knew that it could drift on indefinitely. It was her own dream that had started it, and it was to her dream that she now returned.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I had a very strange dream last night, Mma,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;As I was saying.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Please tell me what it was, Mma,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;I cannot guarantee that I will be able to tell you what it means, but we shall see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I dreamed that I was walking along a path,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe began. &#x201c;And&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi interrupted her. &#x201c;That means you are going on a journey, Mma. There can be no doubt about that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe acknowledged this. &#x201c;Possibly. But then the path came to a place&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is your destination,&#x201d; announced Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;Thatplace that you saw in your dream was your destination in life. That is very clear indeed. What was it like, Mma? Was it a very good place?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There was an acacia tree&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Again there was an interjection. &#x201c;Then that means you are going to end up under a tree, Mma. That is where you will find yourself, under a tree.&#x201d; She looked at Mma Ramotswe sympathetically.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is not too bad, Mma. There are many worse places to end up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But the tree was not all that important,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe, raising her voice slightly to prevent further interruption. &#x201c;There was a man standing under the tree. It was as if he was waiting for me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That will be Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe shook her head. &#x201c;It was not him. It was a man I had never seen before. And he did not come from here. He was a stranger.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s glasses flashed in a slanting band of sunlight. &#x201c;Not from Gaborone?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Not from Botswana?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No. He was from somewhere else. He was not an African at all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi was silent. Then she delivered her judgement. &#x201c;You are going to meet a stranger,&#x201d; she said, with an air of gravity. &#x201c;You are going to meet a stranger under an acacia tree.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I thought it might mean something like that,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;But then I thought that it probably didn&#x2019;t mean anything at all. That it was just a dream, and I would forget about it by this afternoon.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi looked doubtful. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you should forget it, Mma Ramotswe. I think that you should remember it, so that when it happens, when you meet that stranger under the acacia tree, you will be prepared.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She said nothing more, but gave Mma Ramotswe an oblique look; a look that Mma Ramotswe interpreted as a warning. But she had not understood&#x2014;for all her claims to understanding dreams, Mma Makutsi had missed the point. This stranger was not threatening; this stranger, for whom Mma Makutsi said she should be prepared, was not somebody to be dreaded or guarded against. On the contrary, this stranger was a good man, a kind man, and his arrival&#x2014;if he were ever to come, which was highly unlikely&#x2014;was something to be welcomed, something to be celebrated. And there was something else&#x2014;something that was hard to put into words. The man in the dream might have been a stranger in that she had never seen him before, but somehow she felt that she knew him. <i>She knew him but did not know him.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>She glanced at her watch again. Resolve can be weakened by time, and by talk about dreams and by heat.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a bit early, but I think that we should have tea now,&#x201d; she said to Mma Makutsi. And Mma Makutsi, who had removed her glasses to clean them, looked up, finished her task of polishing the lenses and said that she completely agreed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;On a hot day,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;we dream of tea.&#x201d;</p><h2>How to Really Love Your Angry Child</h2><p>In this extrordinary book, Dr. Ross Campbell helps parents manifest love toward their children in all situations of child-rearing through the teen years.</p><p><b><i>Dr. D.

Here you&#39;ll collect random pictures that appeal to you-images culled from periodicals or cut out of catalogs, photographs, or postcards. And here, with Sarah&#39;s encouragement, you&#39;ll reverently and reflectively assemble them into collages that reveal just about anything you might ever want to know about yourself. Your passions. Your preferences. What tickles you. What ticks you off. What makes you happy. From discovering why a certain shade of blue makes you smile, to suddenly comprehending the source of a problem in a friendship, to recognizing your deep spiritual beliefs, the nine sections of The Illustrated Discovery Journal will lead you to the hidden side of your authentic self as no other book can.</p><p>This spiral-bound journal, conceived by Sarah Ban Breathnach, is designed to encourage writers to explore their life stories and unleash dormant creativity. Every two-page spread is exquisitely bordered by a wood print leaf pattern and includes a sage little quote to set the mood or beckon the muse (such as "People who keep journals have life twice." --Jessamyn West). The large format (11.25 by 9.75 inches) gives writers plenty of room to scrawl down their thoughts and even offers ample space for adding personal artwork or gluing in cut-out images. Several pocket folders are bound into the back for carrying clippings, postcards, or dry leaves--whatever whimsy dictates. Because it is spiral bound (with a sturdy wrap-around cover), writers can lay the book flat while at work--a major convenience.<p> Interspersed throughout the journal, Ban Breathnach has added suggestions for writing exercises and collages, plus discussions of themes such as "Success," "Mystery," or "Return to Self." In one spread, Natalie Goldberg is quoted as saying, "Your first job is to get your own story straight." There's no doubt that writers can do just that with this literary example of functional art. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p></p><h2>Principles of Brewing Science</h2><p>This technical book thouroughly explains the fundamental chemistry and biochemistry of brewing great beer.</p><p>This technical book thoroughly explains the fundamental chemistry and biochemistry of brewing great beer.

After receiving his Masters from Duke University in 1981, he decided that west coast marine life was more to his liking. A brief stint at the Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara exposed him to underwater photography, and he has since had photographs used by numerous magazines and textbooks, and at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. He formerly managed the display, culture and acquisition of jellies for the Outer Bay Wing at the Monterey Bay Aquarium which provides continuous exposure to the lives of gelatinous zooplankton, and hopes to make the study of these creatures a life-long endeavor. <p>Claudia Mills has been studying medusae and ctenophores for 25 years.

As smoke yet rises from a bloody battlefield, a dejected general proffers his sword to his victorious opponent. Frock-coated ministers exchange red leather&#x2013;bound treaty books in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. These are iconic images of war&#x2019;s end, but even when they are historically accurate, they conceal more than they convey. Not all wars end decisively. Indeed, the endings of most wars are messy, complicated, inconclusive, and deeply intriguing. As the United States attempts to extricate itself from two long and costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, nothing could be more relevant than a look back at the ways America has ended its major conflicts in the past. It is a topic that has been curiously overlooked. <br><br>Edited and with an introduction by Col. Matthew Moten, a professor of history at West Point, <i>Between War and Peace </i>explores the endings of fourteen American wars, from the Revolution to the first Gulf War. Here, with incisive insight, narrative flourish, and strategic detail, some of America&#x2019;s leading historians examine the progress of America&#x2019;s wars: their initial aims&#x2014;often quite different from their ends&#x2014;their predominant strategies, their final campaigns, the painful journeys out of war, and the ramifications of the wars&#x2019; ends for the nation&#x2019;s future. <br><br>This timely and important book confronts one of the most pressing issues of our time: how do we end conflict and how do we deal with the country we are leaving behind? As recent history has shown, an &#x201c;exit strategy,&#x201d; though it&#x2019;s sometimes neglected, can be as important a piece of military strategy as any. Taken together, these essays break new historical and theoretical ground, building on our current understanding of America&#x2019;s history in ways that few studies have done before. <br><br>A formidable enterprise of historical collaboration, <i>Between War and Peace </i>takes readers inside the climactic moments of America&#x2019;s wars, offering a penetrating look at the past in hopes of illuminating future debates that will determine the nation&#x2019;s course between war and peace.</p><p>&nbsp;Colonel Matthew Moten is professor and deputy head of the Department of History at the United States Military Academy.&nbsp; A graduate of West Point, he has served in the U.S. Army for over twenty-seven years, including assignments in the Pentagon, Germany, Kuwait, and Iraq.&nbsp; He specializes in the history of American political-military relations.&nbsp; His recent publications include an essay entitled &#x201c;A Broken Dialogue: Rumsfeld, Shinseki, and Civil-Military Tension,&#x201d; in <i>American Civil-Military Relations: The Soldier and the State in a New Era</i> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009) and a short monograph entitled <i>The Army Officer&#x2019;s Professional Ethic&#x2014;Past, Present and Future</i> (Strategic Studies Institute, February 2010).&nbsp; He is currently writing a history of American political-military relations.&nbsp; Colonel Moten holds a doctorate in history from Rice University and is author of <i>The Delafield Commission and the American Military Profession </i>(Texas A&amp;M Press, 2000).&nbsp; He and his wife Margaret have two grown children, Stephanie and Marshall.<b><b>ROGER J. SPILLER</b><br><br><b>Six Propositions</b></b><br><br>For years the Corinthians had been storing up resentments against the Athenians, whose power was great, and growing. They were aggressive. The Corinthians said that the Athenians &#x201c;possess a thing almost as soon as they have begun to desire it, so quickly with them does action follow upon decision.&#x201d;1 As if preparing for war, the Athenians had fortified their city and closed to the Corinthians the market at Athens and all the ports in the Athenian Empire. They had taken possession of Corcyra and were even now laying siege against Potidaea, both Corinthian colonies. The Athenians were insufferable, arrogant. They falsely claimed the privilege of their arrogance by right of having defeated the Persian invasion years before, when everyone knew, the Corinthians said, the real reason for Persia&#x2019;s defeat was a mistaken policy by the Persians themselves. Far from beneficent, the Athenian Empire was rapacious, and it endangered the peace.<br><br>And so the Corinthians mobilized opinion among the lesser city-states of the Peloponnesus and laid their grievances before Sparta&#x2019;s governing assembly, the Ekklesia. If the Spartans could be convinced of the injustices Corinth suffered, a coalition to oppose the Athenians might be raised to defend their liberties behind Spartan shields. The Spartans, nursing resentments of their own, were receptive to these complaints. The Ekklesia seemed almost certain to declare for war against Athens.<br><br>A group of Athenians already in Sparta tending to other affairs learned of the Corinthians&#x2019; maneuvers and petitioned to address the Ekklesia, hoping to dissuade Sparta&#x2019;s leaders from giving in to Corinth&#x2019;s demands for war. The Athenians were not defensive, and they did not apologize for their power. &#x201c;We did not gain this empire by force,&#x201d; they declared. &#x201c;We have done nothing extraordinary, nothing contrary to human nature in accepting an empire when it was offered to us and then in refusing to give it up.&#x201d;2 The Athenians&#x2019; message was blunt: a war against Athens would be both unworthy and unwise. Athens would fight. Regardless of the confidence that might propel Sparta into war, Sparta was taking a risk. Who could predict how a war might end? The Athenians concluded their brief with a warning: &#x201c;Think, too, of the great part that is played by the unpredictable in war: think of it now, before you are actually committed to war. The longer a war lasts, the more things tend to depend on accident. Neither you nor we can see into them; we have to abide their outcome in the dark.&#x201d;3<br><br>The Athenians&#x2019; warning was to no avail. Sparta declared war on Athens, igniting thirty years of tragedy, &#x201c;death in every shape and form&#x201d; that spread beyond the confines of ancient Greece from Sicily to Macedonia.4 The Athenians&#x2019; defiant confidence did not protect them from disaster, however. They lost the war, suffered the dismantlement of their empire, and saw their mother city reduced to a shadow of its former glory, its golden age brought to a definitive end.<br><br>The Athenians were not wrong to have been confident. History had been kind to them, and they saw no reason it would not continue to be so. Their leaders did not imagine victory would be won easily, but they were sure Athens would win in the end. Had they been less certain of their power they would have mollified the Spartans and their allies, relaxed their markets, and lifted their sieges. They would have relinquished the power they had attained, but this they would not, or could not, do. Yet in all their calculations they had not foreseen how their strategies would go awry, how successes would lose their potency and lead to reverses, how nature itself might intervene with a cruel plague, and how their leaders, thinking more of their own fortunes than those of their fellow citizens, would squander their advantages. The Athenians had failed to heed their own warning.<br><br>The way we commonly see war and how it ends comes to us from the world of the soldier. This world is highly utilitarian and quite simple in its most basic form: <i>If I kill enough of the enemy, the rest will stop fighting and I can live.</i> In this way the soldier means to impose control over events that are fundamentally unpredictable and chaotic. The chain of command from which he and his comrades receive their orders not only describes how this control is managed; it is also a <i>chain of knowledge,</i> prescribing how military ideas are organized.<br><br>In its ideal form this chain of military thought is hierarchical and deductive, proceeding from the general to the specific. Strategy sets the terms and objectives; campaigns are designed to meet those terms and objectives by means of engagements and battles, which are themselves composed of smaller unit actions and minor tactical events.<br><br>This is a world in which causes are meant to be translated into effects, in which decision is to lead as directly as possible to action. Successful actions are supposed to result in successful engagements whose sum will produce successful campaigns leading to the attainment of final victory. The ideal map has one straight road to victory. It is somewhat amazing that for some time the world&#x2019;s armies, great and small, have fought in consonance with this worldview, especially as it has so often proved to have little relevance to real war.<br><br>This highly structured world is also suffused with a unique value system, built upon good and practical reasons. In earlier days war was a blunt instrument, no more fit for surgery than an axe. Orchestrating the use of military power was very difficult even in ideal conditions, and soldiers regarded with a jaundiced eye any scheme that required them to reserve or limit their strength. Even now the principle of economy of force is sometimes seen as subtracting from an army&#x2019;s main effort. Soldiers everywhere have always preferred to be stronger than their enemy, so strong that the outcome of their war will be in no doubt. If one is <i>very</i> much stronger, so much the better; the enemy may be compelled to surrender without a fight, or he may be defeated quickly and thoroughly, thus sparing lives and treasure on both sides. For these reasons a soldier is bound to regard <i>any sort of limitation</i> on his strength as playing with his life.<br><br>But we outside the soldier&#x2019;s world are not obliged to see war in this way. To do so would make us like physicians who see an illness only from the patient&#x2019;s point of view. The soldier&#x2019;s perspective might serve him well, but that is not to say it advances our knowledge of war equally well.<br><br>This essay addresses the conduct of war and how it ends, seen from the perspective of the American military experience. Although its chief concern is how America&#x2019;s most important conflicts drew to a close, it is based on the premise that the actions of all wars and the conclusions they produce cannot be separated from one another or indeed from the influences of the world beyond the battlefield. To that end I advance six general propositions about the history of American war termination and its implications for the conduct of modern limited war, propositions that may at first glance seem counterintuitive from the soldier&#x2019;s perspective:<br><ol><li><br>Wars are defined not by their extremes but by their limitations. The concepts of absolute war, total war, and total victory are theoretical abstractions whose function is to depict an ideal case against which real war can be understood and conducted.<br></li><li><br>War&#x2019;s original aims and methods, no matter how unyielding or uncompromising they may seem at first, are constantly revised by the stresses and actions of war.<br></li><li><br>In every war the aims of all sides, no matter how opposed at the beginning, gradually converge toward an agreement to stop fighting.<br></li><li><br>This convergence of aims is not produced on the battlefield alone. It is also driven by wider influences beyond the battlefield, only some of which may be manipulated by policymakers, strategists, or operational commanders.<br></li><li><br>The public face of war is ever more cosmopolitan, and so therefore is the conduct of war itself, which can no longer be quarantined from the influence of the world beyond, if it ever could.<br></li><li><br>Within the confines of war itself, a war&#x2019;s terminal campaign exercises the greatest influence over the manner in which it ends, and therefore is not always a war&#x2019;s final campaign. This suggests that the concept of a decisive campaign or victory is not as useful as orthodox military thought has traditionally assumed.<br></li></ol><br>In 1965 the U.S. Army&#x2019;s dictionary of military terms defined <i>doctrine</i> as &#x201c;the best available military thought that can be defended by reason.&#x201d; This definition was admirably idealistic. If reason controls military doctrine, it is the sort of reason that is a creature of the moment, for military doctrine is above all a modern army&#x2019;s way of thinking out loud about what it must do next. For one who studies doctrine but doesn&#x2019;t have to act on it, doctrine therefore is valuable for what it reveals about the state of military thought and practice at a particular point in time.<br><br>Current American military doctrine refers to <i>war termination</i> as the conclusion of &#x201c;operations on terms favorable to the United States.&#x201d; Defense strategists and operational planners are enjoined to keep the question of how a conflict might end uppermost in their minds as they go about their work. The doctrine makes clear that strategies and plans should aim toward a certain &#x201c;end state,&#x201d; which must be in accord with the goals of the conflict as set by national policy. Once the course of action has been decided, the doctrine recognizes that plans may well be interrupted by &#x201c;unforeseen events&#x201d; that force a &#x201c;reassessment&#x201d; of the terms on which hostilities will be concluded. Doctrine is less definitive about how all this might actually be accomplished.<br><br>That the subject of war termination is addressed at all is somewhat surprising. As a term of art <i>war termination</i> is of fairly recent vintage, having made its appearance during the First World War. There was no serious work on the subject between the two world wars, and although there was official and scholarly interest in the termination of a hypothetical nuclear war during the Cold War years, it was overshadowed by developments in nuclear arms control. Among social scientists toward the end of the war in Vietnam the subject attracted academic interest that persisted to the end of the century.5 Only a few military theorists and historians paid any attention to the problem, and the subject does not seem to have found its way into professional military thinking. Now the term is not frequently heard in war or staff colleges, and over the past twenty years professional military journals have offered but two essays on the subject.6 It is not difficult to understand why. The term implies something less than the ideal outcome of a war: reservation, equivocation, ambiguity, limitation&#x2014;substitutes for victory.<br><br><i>Victory:</i> for centuries statesmen, soldiers, and scholars have made do with this simpler, more encompassing concept of how wars end. The nature of victory seemed so self-evident it was seldom if ever examined. In its classical, ideal form, victory meant the triumph by force of arms over one&#x2019;s enemy, the kind of success to which the enemy cannot reply by force and which rewards the victor with complete freedom of action. This was the only proper goal of war. To aim for less or to settle for less was to expose oneself to the enemy&#x2019;s actions and to squander the sacrifices in blood and treasure war always demands. How a war ended was seen as the logical result of battlefield successes and failures, a final reckoning toward which all sides struggled. Every battlefield success contributed to final victory, and every failure subtracted from the possibility of attaining it. Victory settled all questions, one way or another. Indeed professional soldiers could hardly afford the luxury of thinking any other way. They would react instinctively against any suggestion that the course of a war toward its conclusion is a more complex process than treasuring up successes or guarding against reverses. &#x201c;Man does not enter battle to fight,&#x201d; one soldier wrote, &#x201c;but for victory. He does everything that he can to avoid the first and obtain the second.&#x201d;7<br><br>Soldiers are likely to recoil at the thought that a battlefield defeat might in some way contribute to their ultimate goal. The American survivors of Japan&#x2019;s victory at Pearl Harbor would not take kindly to the suggestion that their defeat exercised a far greater influence over the outcome of the Pacific War than if they had successfully repelled the attack with little loss of life or damage to the Pacific Fleet. Yet the defeat at Pearl Harbor drove the United States to declare war sooner than it might have. The vulnerability of its battleships forced the United States to create a new fleet of aircraft carriers that would carry the burdens of its war far more effectively. And for Americans on the home front as well as the fighting front, Pearl Harbor served as a powerful incentive for retribution until the day the <i>Enola Gay</i> appeared over Hiroshima. But if you were to ask a veteran of Pearl Harbor whether any of these results lessened the sting of his defeat, you need have no doubt about the answer.<br><br>Today you will search in vain for any definition of <i>victory</i> in American military doctrine. Exactly when the classical ideal of victory disappeared from official doctrine is an open question, but its absence invites the thought that at some time in the recent past, victory, which so long dominated military thought and practice, lost some of its official appeal. Regardless of its present status in public discourse or as a doctrinal term, however, victory has by no means gone out of fashion, and there is no reason to think that <i>war termination,</i> with its vaguely clinical, antiseptic feel, is likely to supplant it anytime soon. The ideal of victory still exerts a powerful hold over modern war making. This ideal was what General Schwarzkopf had in mind when he recalled the end of the First Gulf War. &#x201c;Our side had <i>won,</i>&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;so we were in a position to dictate terms.&#x201d; His meeting with Iraqi commanders at Safwan that halted the fighting, he insisted, was in no way a transaction. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to tell them exactly what we expect them to do,&#x201d; he told reporters at the time.8 A dozen years later, under a banner on the USS <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> proclaiming &#x201c;Mission Accomplished,&#x201d; President George W. Bush declared victory in the second Iraq War, just as his secretary of defense had done after the initial campaign in Afghanistan had overthrown the Taliban. These are only the latest instances across the long expanse of the American military experience in which the ideal of victory met its limits. As Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago, once one moves &#x201c;from the abstract to the real world, the whole thing looks quite different.&#x201d;9<br><br>* * * <br><br>Since the American Revolution the world has seen more than 650 wars, more than a third of which have occurred since the Second World War.10 The American military experience, according to the neat divisions of history, includes twelve major conflicts, from revolution and civil war to colonial and imperial wars, wars against other nations as well as irregular wars. Some of these, such as the Mexican War, the 300-Years War against the Native Americans, and the Spanish-American and Philippine Wars, have been blatantly aggressive; others have been less so. In some cases aggression is very much defined by the mind of the beholder. How one classifies the Mexican War, for instance, depends on t...</p><h2>Aunt Dimity Goes West</h2><p>Arriving in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado only to find herself enmeshed in a missing-persons case, Lori Sheppard becomes increasingly suspicious about a hundred-year-old mystery and a charming man who seems to know more than he will admit.

Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent. He roams the country seeking assignments, but gradually comes to realise that while some of his quarry are unremittingly vile, vicious grotesques, others are the victims of sin, evil or simple naivety. One reviewer said: &#39;This book is a sheer delight. It is beautifully written, full of vitality and endlessly inventive: its format, with half a dozen episodes and intervening rest periods for both the hero and the reader, allows for a huge range of characters, scenarios and action. It&#39;s thought-provoking without being in the least dogmatic, witty without descending to farce and packed with swordfights without being derivative. The dialogue sparkles; characters morph almost imperceptibly from semi-cliche to completely original; nothing is as it first seems.Sapkowski succeeds in seamlessly welding familiar ideas, unique settings and delicious twists of originality: his Beauty wants to rip the throa It&#39;s easily one of the best things I&#39;ve read in ages.&#39;</p><p>Andrzej Sapkowski was born in 1948 in Poland.

His devout and excruciating attention to the line and its indispensable music fuses his implacable understanding of words with their own shadows.&#x201d; &#x2015;Rachel Eliza Griffiths, <i>Boston Review</i><br> <br> &#x201c;This gorgeous debut is a &#x2018;debut&#x2019; in chronology only, a rare poetic event that transcends our expectations. Williams&#x2019;s poems embody balance: uncompromising and magnetic, surprising and intuitive. Need is everywhere&#x2015;in the unforgiving images, in lines so delicate they seem to break apart in the hands, and in the reader who will enter these poems and never want to leave.&#x201d; &#x2015;Adrian Matejka, author of <i>The Big Smoke</i><br> <br> &#x201c;Not just more of the artfully skill-less, conceptual talk of a poem, this is what you&#x2019;ve been waiting for: some poetry. Not just skill as possession, as a commodity, but skill to accomplish the expressive event, a deeply felt poetic argument. For example Williams&#x2019; line is no arbitrary unit of type, but an effective musically syntactic accomplishment of line. Poetry!&#x201d; &#x2015;Ed Roberson<br> <br> &#x201c;Williams demonstrates an astounding technical mastery of poetic forms that goes far beyond form for form&#x2019;s sake, as he repeats, reconfigures, and recontextualizes words and phrases in order to create continuity and multifaceted meanings.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Muzzle Magazine</i><br> <br> &#x201c;. . .Thief in the Interior is a remarkable collection that balances engagement with both the horrific and the beautiful.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Southern Humanities Review</i><br> <br> &#x201c;Thief in the Interior does what a collection of poems should do. It draws its reader in and forces its reader to think, to admire, to observe, to question and to whip out the notebook and go nuts on the adjectives&#x2015;dynamic, robust, dominant, vigorous, inventive, vigorous, original, musical, original, and adroit.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Adroit Journal</i><br> <br> &#x201c;<i>Thief in the Interior</i> damns and redeems, and represents a truly worthwhile literary experience.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Blackbird</i></p><h2>The Green Brain</h2><p>In an overpopulated world seeking living room in the jungles, the International Ecological Organization was systematically exterminating the voracious insects that made these areas uninhabitable. Using deadly foamal bombs and newly developed vibration weapons, men like Joao Martinho and his coworkers fought to clear the green hell of the Mato Grosso. But somehow those areas that had been completely cleared were becoming reinfested, despite the impenetrable vibration barriers. And tales were coming out of the jungles-tales of insects mutated to incredible sizes, of creatures who seemed to be men but whose eyes gleamed with the chitinous sheen of insects...</p><p>Frank Herbert's most popular works are the well-known Dune books: Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, and the extraordinary bestseller God Emperor of Dune.<br><br>Scott Brick has recorded over five hundred audiobooks, won over forty AudioFile Earphones Awards, and twice received Audie Awards for his work. Scott was chosen as Publishers Weekly's 2007 Narrator of the Year, and he has been named a Golden Voice by AudioFile magazine.<p><strong>1</strong><br>He looked pretty much like the bastard offspring of a Guarani Indio and some backwoods farmer&#x2019;s daughter, some <em>sertanista</em>who&#x2019;d tried to forget her enslavement to the <em>encomendero</em>system by &#x201c;eating the iron&#x201d;--which is what they call lovemaking through the grill of a consel gate.<br><br>The type-look was almost perfect expect when he forgot himself while passing through one of the deeper jungle glades.<br><br>His skin tended to shade down to green then, fading him into the background of leaves and vines, giving a ghostly disembodiment to the mud-gray shirt and ragged trousers, the inevitable frayed straw hat and rawhide sandals soled with pieces cut from worn tires.<br><br>Such lapses grew less and less frequent the farther he emerged from the Panara headwaters, the <em>sertao</em>hinterland of Goyaz where men with his bang-cut black hair and glittering dark eyes were common.<br><br>By the time he reached <em>bandeirantes</em>country, he had achieved almost perfect control over the chameleon effect.<br><br>Now, he was out of the wilder jungle growth and into the brown dirt tracks that separated the parceled farms of the resettlement plan. In his own way, he knew he was approaching one of the bandeirante checkpoints, and with an almost human gesture he fingered the<em>cedula de graicias al sacar,</em>the certificate of white blood, tucked safely beneath his shirt. Now and again, when humans were not near, he practiced aloud the name that had been chosen for him--&#x201d;Antonio Raposo Tavares.&#x201d;<br><br>The sound emerged a bit strident, harsh on the edges, but he knew it would pass. It already had. Goyaz Indios were notorious for the strange inflection of their speech. The farm folk who&#x2019;d given him a roof and food the previous night had said as much.<br><br>When their question had become pressing, he&#x2019;d squatted on their doorstep and played his flute, the <em>qena</em>of the Andes Indian, which he carried in a leather purse hung from his shoulder. The gesture of the flute was a symbol of the region. When a Guarani put flute to nose and began playing, that said words were ended.<br><br>The farm folk had shrugged and retired.<br><br>His trudging progress, the difficult and carefully mastered articulation of legs, had brought him now into an area of many humans. He crystal shimmering of a bandeirante tower with its aircars alighting and departing. The scene held an odd hive-look.<br><br>Momentarily, he found himself overcome by the touch of instincts that he knew he must master. These instincts could make him fail the ordeal to come. He stepped off the dirt track, out of the path of passing humans, and went through the regimen that united his mental identity. The resultant thought penetrated to the smallest and most remote units of his person: We are greenslaves subservient to the greater whole.<br><br>He resumed his way toward the bandeirante checkpoint. The unifying thought lent him an air of servility that was like a shield against the stares of humans trudging past all around. His kind knew many human mannerisms. They had learned early that servility was a form of concealment.<br><br>Presently, the dirt track gave way to a two-lane paved market road with footpaths in the ditches on both sides. This, in turn, curved alongside a four-deck commercial transport highway where even the footpaths were paved. Now there were groundcars and aircars in greater numbers, and the flow of foot traffic increased.<br><br>Thus far he&#x2019;d attracted no dangerous attention. The occasional snickering side-glance from natives of the area could be safely ignored. He watched for probing stares. These could hold peril, but he detected none.<br><br>Servility shielded him.<br><br>The sun stood well along toward mid-morning and the day&#x2019;s heat had begun to press down on the earth, raising a moist hothouse stink from the dirt beside the pathway, mingling it with the perspiration odors of humanity around him. There was a sourness to the smell that made every part of him long for the sweetly familiar odors of the hinterland. And the lowland smells carried another harmonic that filled him with an inaudible humming of unease. Here were greater and greater concentrations in insect poisons.<br><br>Humans were all around him now, close and pressing, moving slower and slower as they approached the checkpoint bottleneck. The forward motion stopped.<br><br>Progress resolved itself into shuffle and stop, shuffle and stop....<br><br>Here was the critical test and no avoiding it. He waited with something akin to an Indian&#x2019;s stoic patience. His breathing had grown deeper to compensate for the heat. He adjusted it to match that of the humans around him, suffering the temperature rise for the sake of blending into his surroundings. Andes Indians did&#x2019;t breathe deeply here in the lowlands.<br><br>Shuffle and stop.<br><br>Shuffle and stop.<br><br>Now he could see the checkpoint.<br><br>Fastidious bandeirantes in sealed white cloaks with plastic helmets, gloves and boots stood in a double row within a shaded brick corridor leading into the town. He could see sunlight hot on the street beyond the corridor, people hurrying away there after passing this gantlet.<br><br>the sight of that free area beyond the corridor sent an ache of longing through all the parts of him. The suppression warning flashed out instantly on the heels of that instinctive reaching-emotion.<br><br>No distraction could be permitted here. Every element of him had to be alert to withstand the pain.<br><br>Shuffle and...he was into the hands of the first bandeirante, a hulking blond fellow with pink skin and blue eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Step along now! Lively now!&#x201d; the fellow said.<br><br>A gloved hand propelled him toward two bandeirantes standing on the right side of the line.<br><br>&#x201c;Name?&#x201d; <em>That was a voice behind him</em>.<br><br>&#x201c;Antonio Raposo Tavares,&#x201c; he rasped.<br><br>&#x201c;District?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Goyaz.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Give that one an extra treatment,&#x201c; the blond giant called. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s from the upcountry for certain.&#x201d;<br><br>The two waiting bandeirantes had him now, one jamming a breather mask over his face, the other dropping a plastic bag over him. A tube trailed from the bag and out toward the sound of machinery somewhere in the street beyond the corridor.<br><br>&#x201c;Double shot!&#x201d; one of the bandeirantes called.<br><br>Fuming blue gas puffed out the bag around him, and he inhaled a sharp, gasping breath through the mask, astonished at that unanimous demand for poison-free air.<br><br>Agony!<br><br>The gas drove through every multiple linkage of his being with needles of pain.<br><br><em>We must not weaken</em>, he thought. <em>Hold fast</em>.<br><br>But it was a deadly pain, killing. Linkages began to weaken.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay on this one,&#x201c; the bag handler called.<br><br>The bag was slipped off, breather mask pulled away. Hands propelled him down the corridor toward the sunlight.<br><br>&#x201c;Lively now! Don&#x2019;t hold up the line.&#x201d;<br><br>The stink of the poison gas lay all around him. It was a new one--a dissembler. They hadn&#x2019;t prepared him for this poison. He&#x2019;d been ready for the radiations and the sonics and the old chemicals...but not for this.<br><br>Sunlight beat down on him as he emerged from the corridor into a street. He veered left through a passage lined by fruit stalls, merchants bartering with customers or standing fat and watchful behind their displays.<br><br>In this extremity, the fruit beckoned with the promise of sanctuary for a few parts of him, but the integrating totality of him knew the emptiness of that thought. He fought off the lure, shuffled fast as he dared, dodging past customers, through the knots of idlers.<br><br>&#x201c;You like to buy fresh oranges?&#x201d;<br><br>An oily dark hand thrust two oranges into his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Fresh oranges from the green country. Never been a bug near these.&#x201d;<br><br>He avoided the hand, but the odor of the oranges came near to overpowering him.<br><br>Now he was clear of the stalls, around a corner down a narrow side street. Another corner and he saw far away to his left the lure of greenery of open country, the free area beyond the town.<br><br>He turned toward the green, increasing his speed, measuring out the time still available to him. He knew it would be a near thing. Poison clung to his clothing, but clean air filtered through the fabric--and the thought of possible victory was like an antidote.<br><br><em>We can make it yet</em>!<br><br>The green drew closer and closer--trees and ferns beside a river bank. He heard running water, smelled wet soil. There was a bridge thronging with foot traffic from converging streets.<br><br>No help for it--he joined the throng, avoided contact where possible. His leg and back linkages were beginning to slip, and he knew the wrong kind of blow, a chance collision, could dislodge whole segments.<br><br>The bridge ordeal ended and he saw a dirt track leading off the path to the right and down toward the river. He turned toward it, stumbled against one of two men carrying a pig in a net slung between them. Part of the skin simulation on his right upper leg gave way. He could feel it begin to slip down inside his trousers.<br><br>The man he&#x2019;d hit took two backward steps, almost dropped the pig.<br><br>&#x201c;Careful!&#x201d; the man shouted.<br><br>The man&#x2019;s companion said, &#x201c;Damn drunkis.&#x201d;<br><br>The pig set up a squirming, squealing distraction.<br><br>In this moment, he slipped past the men onto the dirt track, shuffled toward the river. He could see water down there now boiling with aeration from the barrier filters, the form of sonic disruption on its surface.<br><br>Behind him, one of the pig carriers said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t...</p></p><h2>Revenge of the Hawk</h2><p>John Cooper Baines, an American frontiersman who has created a new home for himself and family in Texas, must defend his ranch and lifestyle when war erupts with Mexico</p><p></p><h2>Modern Quilting: 25 step-by-step projects for cool and contemporary patchwork and quilts</h2><p>Follow Michael Caputo&#39;s tutorials for every skill level to make gorgeous quilts and patchwork with 25 modern designs in an array of colourful fabrics.

The dead woman's husband is an arrogant philanderer, but Kenyon lacks solid evidence that he was the one who disposed of his inconveniently pregnant wife in a particularly grisly manner. Meanwhile, Kenyon's ex-partner in the Seattle PD, Chris Collier, is pressuring her to make a decision concerning their ongoing romantic relationship. After one failed marriage and singlehandedly raising her daughter, Jenna, Emily is gun-shy about any kind of commitment. When Barton targets Jenna, tension builds but is diffused by Barton's overly extensive backstory, which humanizes him at the cost of the reader's attention. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Love is the nectar that inspires us as poets and parents, companions and neighbors, siblings and citizens.

Here is love in all its facets: the adoration of a girl as she gazes into her father's eyes; the passion of young lovers kissing beside a fountain; the attachment of a boy to his dog; the contentment of a family asleep at the beach; the devotion of an elderly wife reading to her husband from a book written in Braille; the tenderness of a little sister embracing her big brother; the affection of two entwined fingers.</p><p>The M.I.L.K. project was conceived to revere what it is to love and be loved.

There&#x2019;s never enough time, not when a person has become a part of you. We were lucky to survive the war, my wife and I, and not a day passes that I don&#x2019;t think of those we lost. I know it&#x2019;s greedy to want just one more week, one more month, one more year with her when we were already given so much time. The last half century has been a gift we never expected, perhaps a gift we never deserved.<br> <br>Still, I can&#x2019;t let go. I can&#x2019;t imagine my world without her, for my life didn&#x2019;t really begin until the day we met. But I&#x2019;m as powerless to protect her in this moment as I was all those years ago in Paris, though both then and now I tried to fool myself into believing I had some control.<br> <br>I rise quietly, careful not to disturb her. When she awakens, the pain will return, so while I yearn for her company, I&#x2019;m grateful that for now, she&#x2019;s at peace.<br> <br>I shuffle into the kitchen, boil water in our electric kettle, steep some Earl Grey tea, and make my way to the front porch. It&#x2019;s March, so the air is crisp, as crisp as it gets here in Antelope Valley, some sixty miles north of Los Angeles. I stare into the misty morning, and my breath catches in my throat when I see it: the first bloom of the season. In the coming weeks, the fields will turn brilliant shades of yellow, orange, and red. My wife will almost certainly be gone by then, but at least she&#x2019;ll have this, one last dawn to the poppy season.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I say, looking upward to where I imagine God must be. &#x201c;Thank you for this.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been talking to God a lot lately, which is strange because during the war I might have argued that He didn&#x2019;t exist. But in the years since, I&#x2019;ve surprised myself by slowly wending my way back to faith. It began with our daughter, Nadia, for there&#x2019;s no denying that she was a miracle. And when she had three healthy children of her own, I believed a little more. When our grandchildren gave us great-grandchildren, and my wife and I were still here, I had no choice but to acknowledge a higher power.<br> <br>Then again, perhaps I&#x2019;d known on some level that He was there all along, because what other explanation could there have been for my wife and me finding each other in the midst of such chaos all those years ago?<br> <br>As I gaze out at the rolling fields, I can see our lives unfolding here, our daughter twirling in the sunlight, our grandchildren chasing each other through the blooms. I sip my tea and blink a few times to clear my vision. It&#x2019;s embarrassing how emotional I&#x2019;ve grown lately. Men aren&#x2019;t supposed to cry, especially men of my generation. But when it comes to the love of my life, I&#x2019;m powerless against the tide.<br> <br>I finish my tea and head back into the house to check on her. She should still be sleeping, but I find her in bed with her eyes open, her head tilted toward the door. She&#x2019;s still beautiful, even in old age, even as she succumbs to the cancer we caught too late. &#x201c;Good morning, my love,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good morning, my darling girl.&#x201d; I force a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have the poppies bloomed yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod, and her eyes fill with tears. I know they&#x2019;re tears of happiness, and I share her joy. &#x201c;Just one for now,&#x201d; I reply. &#x201c;But the others won&#x2019;t be far behind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What color, my love? What color is the first one?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Red. The first poppy of the season is red.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; She lies back and smiles. &#x201c;Of course it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>When she focuses on me again, we gaze at each other for a long time. Looking into her eyes always washes the decades away and takes me back to the day I first saw her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I must ask something of you,&#x201d; she says softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; I know what it is before she says the words.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to go to the top of the hill just once more. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will take you.&#x201d; My strength has waned with time; I had a heart attack last year, and I haven&#x2019;t felt like myself since. But I knew this would be my darling girl&#x2019;s last wish, and I will make it come true, whatever it takes. &#x201c;We can go when you&#x2019;re ready. But let&#x2019;s wait a few more days until the poppies are fully in bloom.&#x201d; Of course, the request is partially a selfish one; I want to give her a reason to hang on a little longer, to stay with me.<br> <br>She smiles. &#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s already fading, her eyelids heavy, her gaze growing unfocused. &#x201c;She should be here, though, not me,&#x201d; she whispers after a moment. &#x201c;It always should have been her.&#x201d; I know exactly who she&#x2019;s talking about: her best friend, the one who was like a sister to her, the one we lost so senselessly all those years ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;God had a plan, my darling.&#x201d; I can&#x2019;t say what I really want to, which is that I&#x2019;m grateful it was my wife who survived. That&#x2019;s a selfish, terrible thing to think, isn&#x2019;t it? No one should have died at all. But fate doesn&#x2019;t always play fair.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see her again soon.&#x201d; Her voice is so faint I can hardly hear her as she adds, &#x201c;On the other side. Don&#x2019;t you think I will?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go yet,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d; And as she drifts back to sleep, I sink down into the chair beside her and begin to cry. I don&#x2019;t know how I&#x2019;ll live without her. The truth is, since the day I met her, it&#x2019;s all been for her. My whole life. My whole existence. I don&#x2019;t know how I&#x2019;ll say good-bye.</p><h2>Tough-Minded Leadership</h2><p>Batten offers new insights, focus, and lmotivation for all those committed to greater personal effectiveness as leaders.

In one, a red-headed child born to Henry VIII ascends to the throne after the king's death, leading Britain into a prosperous and joyous future. In the other, another child rules, and with her coronation opens Britain to the fires of the Inquisition. Unbeknownst to Rhoslyn and Pasgen, however, the same double vision comes to their half-siblings among the Bright Court elves, Denoriel and Aleneil. Thus inspired, the two sets of twins set out to force the future they each desire. Denoriel attaches himself to Henry FitzRoy, the bastard son of Henry VIII, who may be the key to ensuring the red-headed child's rule, while Rhoslyn assumes a place in Princess Mary's household. FitzRoy, who grows from a sweet, innocent child into a sweet, innocent young adult, and Denoriel, who goes from reluctant nursemaid to dedicated almost father, get most of the attention, but it's the dark twins who provide the most interest. The mental, magical and eventually physical battle between the two sets of twins speeds the entertaining plot along, and knowledgeable readers&#x2014;hey, that Anne Boleyn is going to lose her head&#x2014;will enjoy the interplay between elven intervention and historical fact. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They can&#x2019;t make it so you didn&#x2019;t wake up in the bad place, or change the truth to lies. The nice doctor and the nice woman from the SART, Sexual Assault Response Team, couldn&#x2019;t change that I had indeed been raped. The fact that I couldn&#x2019;t remember it, because my uncle had used a spell for his date-rape drug, didn&#x2019;t change the evidence&#x2014;the evidence that they&#x2019;d found in my body when they did the exam and took samples.<br><br>You would think being a real live faerie princess would make your life fairy-tale-like, but fairy tales only end well.

The happy-ever-after ending, if it&#x2019;s coming at all, seems a very long way away tonight.<br><br>I was in a hospital bed, in a nice private room, in a very nice hospital. I was in the maternity ward, because I was pregnant, but not with my crazy uncle&#x2019;s baby. I had been pregnant before he stole me away. Pregnant with the children of men I loved. They&#x2019;d risked everything to rescue me from Taranis. Now, I was safe. I had one of the greatest warriors that faerie had ever seen at my side: Doyle, once the Queen&#x2019;s Darkness, and now mine. He stood at the window, staring off into the night that was so ruined by the lights from the hospital parking lot that the blackness of his skin and hair was much darker than the night outside. He&#x2019;d removed the wraparound sunglasses that he almost always wore outside. But his eyes were as black as the glasses that hid them. The only color in the dim light of the room was the glints from the silver rings that climbed the graceful line of one ear to the point that marked him as not pure blood, not truly high court, but mixed blood, like me. The diamonds in his earlobe sparkled in the light as he turned his head, as if he&#x2019;d felt me staring at him. He probably had. He had been the queen&#x2019;s assassin a thousand years before I was born.<br><br>His ankle-length hair moved like a black cloak as he came toward me. He was wearing green hospital scrubs that he&#x2019;d been loaned. They had replaced the blanket from the ambulance that had brought us here. He&#x2019;d entered the golden court, to rescue me, in the form of a large black dog. When he shape-shifted he lost everything, clothes, weapons, but strangely never the piercings. The many earrings and the nipple piercing survived his return to human form, maybe because they were part of him.<br><br>He came to stand beside the bed, and take my hand&#x2014;the one that didn&#x2019;t have the intravenous drip in it, which was helping hydrate me, and get me over the shock I&#x2019;d been in when I had arrived. If I hadn&#x2019;t been with child, they&#x2019;d have probably given me more medicine. For once I wouldn&#x2019;t have minded stronger drugs, something to make me forget. Not just what my uncle, Taranis, had done, but also the loss of Frost.<br><br>I gripped Doyle&#x2019;s hand, my hand so small and pale in his large, dark one. But there should have been another beside him, beside me. Frost, our Killing Frost, was gone. Not dead, not exactly, but lost to us. Doyle could shape-shift to several forms at will and come back to his true form. Frost had had no ability to shape-shift, but when wild magic had filled the estate where we&#x2019;d been living in Los Angeles, it had changed him. He had become a white stag, and run out the doors that had appeared into a piece of faerie that had never existed before the magic came.<br><br>The lands of faerie were growing, instead of shrinking, for the first time in centuries. I, a noble of the high courts, was with child, twins. I was the last child of faerie nobility to be born. We were dying as a people, but maybe not. Maybe we were going to regain our power, but what use to me was power? What use to me was the return of faerie, and wild magic? What use was any of it, if Frost was an animal with an animal&#x2019;s mind?<br><br>The thought that I would bear his child and he would neither know nor understand made my chest tight. I gripped Doyle&#x2019;s hand, but couldn&#x2019;t meet his eyes. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what he would see there. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what I was feeling anymore. I loved Doyle, I did, but I loved Frost, too. The thought that they would both be fathers had been a joyous one.<br><br>He spoke in his deep, deep voice, as if molasses, and other, thick, sweet things, could be words, but what he said wasn&#x2019;t sweet. &#x201c;I will kill Taranis for you.&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head. &#x201c;No, you will not.&#x201d; I had thought about it, because I had known that Doyle would do just what he&#x2019;d said. If I asked, he would try to kill Taranis, and he might succeed. But I could not allow my lover and future king to assassinate the King of Light and Illusion, the king of our enemy court. We were not at war, and even those among the Seelie Court who thought Taranis was mad or even evil would not be able to overlook an assassination. A duel, maybe, but not an assassination. Doyle was within his rights to challenge the king to a duel. I&#x2019;d thought about that, too. I&#x2019;d half liked that idea, but I&#x2019;d seen what Taranis could do with his hand of power. His hand of light could char flesh, and had nearly killed Doyle once before.<br><br>I had let go of any thought of vengeance at Doyle&#x2019;s hand when I weighed it against the thought of losing him too.<br><br>&#x201c;I am the captain of your guard, and I could avenge my honor and yours for that reason alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean a duel,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. He does not deserve a chance to defend himself, but if I assassinate him, it will be war between the courts, and we cannot afford that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;we can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I looked up at him then.<br><br>He touched my face with his free hand. &#x201c;Your eyes glow in the dark with a light of their own, Meredith. Green and gold circles of light in your face. Your emotions betray you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want him dead, yes, but I won&#x2019;t destroy all of faerie for it. I won&#x2019;t get us all kicked out of the United States for my honor. The treaty that let our people come here three hundred years ago stated only two things that would get us kicked out. The courts can&#x2019;t make war on American soil, and we can&#x2019;t allow humans to worship us as deities.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was at the signing of the treaty, Meredith. I know what it said.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled at him, and it seemed strange that I could still smile. The thought made the smile wilt a little around the edges, but I guess it was a good sign. &#x201c;You remember the Magna Carta.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was a human thing, and had little to do with us.&#x201d;<br><br>I squeezed his hand. &#x201c;I was making a point, Doyle.&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled, and nodded. &#x201c;My emotions make me slow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>The door behind him opened. There were two men in the doorway, one tall and one short. Sholto, King of the sluagh, Lord of that Which Passes Between, was as tall as Doyle, and had long, straight hair that fell toward his ankles, but the color was white-blond, and his skin was like mine, moonlight pale. Sholto&#x2019;s eyes were three colors of yellow and gold, as if autumn leaves from three different trees had been melted down to color his eyes, then everything had been edged in gold. The sidhe always have the prettiest eyes. He was as fair of face as any at the courts, except for my lost Frost. The body that showed under the t-shirt and jeans he&#x2019;d worn as part of his disguise when he came to save me seemed to cling to a body as lovely as the face, but I knew that at least part of it was illusion. Starting at his upper ribs, Sholto had extra bits, tentacles, because, though his mother had been high-court nobility, his father had been one of the nightflyers, part of the sluagh, and the last wild hunt of faerie. Well, the last wild hunt until the wild magic had returned. Now, things of legend were returning, and Goddess alone knew what was real again, and what was still to return.<br><br>Until he had a coat or jacket thick enough to hide the extra bits, he would use magic, glamour, to hide the extras. No reason to scare the nurses. It was his lifetime of having to hide his differences that had made him good enough at illusion to risk coming to my rescue. You do not go lightly against the King of Light and Illusion with illusion as your only shield.<br><br>He smiled at me, and it was a smile I had never seen on Sholto&#x2019;s face until the moment at the ambulance when he had held my hand, and told me he knew he would be a father. The news seemed to have softened some harshness that had always been there in his handsome body. He seemed the proverbial new man, as he walked toward us.<br><br>Rhys was not smiling. At 5'6", he was the shortest full-blooded sidhe I&#x2019;d ever met. His skin was moonlight pale, like Sholto&#x2019;s, like mine, like Frost&#x2019;s. Rhys had removed the fake beard and mustache he&#x2019;d worn inside the faerie mound. He&#x2019;d worked at the detective agency in L.A. with me, and he&#x2019;d loved disguises. He was good at them, too, better than at illusion. But he&#x2019;d had enough illusion to hide the...</p><h2>Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)</h2><p>Penetrating the murkiest corners of glittering New Orleans society, Benjamin January brought murderers to justice in <b>A Free Man of Color</b>, <b>Fever Season</b>, and <b>Graveyard Dust</b>.

He belongs to no current movement, lives far from the bicoastal art world, and his paintings consequently defy easy description. This volume, published in conjunction with a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of the Rockies, includes Chatham&#39;s early oils from Northern California as well as the Montana paintings that have brought him national acclaim.</p><p>Russell Chatham lives in Livingston, Montana where he continues to paint the surrounding beauty. Russell also produces Limited Edition lithographs, owns Clark City Press, Inc. &amp; operates Chatham's Livingston Bar &amp; Grille.To the reading public, Russell Chatham may be best known for the paintings which grace the novels of Jim Harrison. Chatham's art has achieved a certain level of recognition, even if the artist's name is not as known as his work. That imbalance, however, is changing with the publication of One Hundred Paintings, the first book dedicated to Chatham's ongoing 30-year career as a visual artist. Chatham - on his own terms paints the Northern California landscape of his upbringing and early adulthood, and the far ranging country of Montana where he currently resides. Chatham is a singular contemporary landscape painter. There are no cowboys, no roaming stallions. Rather, Chatham paints from a spiritual belief in the memory of place an inner view of the outer world. Chatham is also well regarded among the sporting public as an expert fly fisherman - he caught a world-record striped bass in the 1960s - and has authored numerous articles and books including Dark Waters and 7be Angler's Coast. One Hundred Paintings complements his varied reputations, and features a brief introduction by the novelist and poet Jim Harrison, an appreciation by the art historian Chris Waddington, and an autobiographical sketch by Russell Chatham. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>S</h2><p><i>S. </i>is the story of Sarah P.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."</p><h2>The Light in the Window</h2><p>In Ireland, 1951, the young June Goulding took up a position as midwife in a home for unmarried mothers run by the Sacred Heart nuns. What she witnessed there was to haunt her for the next fifty years. It was a place of secrets, lies and cruelty. A place where women picked grass by hand and tarred roads whilst heavily pregnant. Where they were denied any contact with the outside world; denied basic medical treatment and abused for their 'sins'; where, after the birth, they were forced into hard labour in the convent for three years. But worst of all was that the young women were expected to raise their babies during these three years so that they could then be sold&#x2014;given up for adoption in exchange for a donation to the nuns. Shocked by the nuns' inhumane treatment of the frightened young women, June risked her job to bring some light into their dark lives. June's memoir tells the story of twelve women's experiences in this home and of the hardships they endured, but also the kindness she offered them, and the hope she was able to bring.</p><p>June Goulding worked as a midwife in a &#39;home&#39; for unmarried mothers in 1951. She is the mother of seven children and lives in Cork. The Light in the Window is her first book.&#34;&#39;I promised that I would one day write a book and tell the world about the home for unmarried mothers.

But when Rook's inquiry concludes that Detective Heat has arrested the wrong man for the murder, everything changes.<br><br>Balancing her high stakes job with a complicated romance has been a challenge ever since Nikki fell for the famous reporter.

Bibliography. Index. 119p plus a section of 105 black/white plates. Measures 7.25x10.25 inches.</p><p>Grant's paintings of nude men and women embracing have a carefree, sensuous quality. His male nudes and wrestlers are charged with erotic energy. This Bloomsbury painter (1885-1978) won an early following with his large kinetic murals, searching portraits and simple post-impressionist landscapes. He fell out of favor in the 1940s, only to see his reputation revived in the 1970s as figurative painting made a comeback. Turnbaugh curated a Grant retrospective. Surprisingly, this candid, lively biography offers few artistic judgments, but it does dissect a tangled web of relationships. Grant's homosexual love affair with John Maynard Keynes is discussed, as is his comfortable domesticity with Vanessa Bell, who gave him the freedom to take numerous male lovers. One chapter traces his pivotal role in the Omega Workshops, where he innovated in the applied and decorative arts. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Abbey Lubbers, Banshees, &amp; Boggarts: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Fairies</h2><p>A &#34;Who&#39;s Who&#34; of fairyland, with entries by fairy name and additional legends, songs, and anecdotes within each entry.</p><p></p><h2>Don Quijote (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Don Quijote, el ï¿½ltimo caballero is a novel for intermediate and advanced beginners. It uses a vocabulary of fewer than 200 different Spanish words to tell a 1,400-word story in the present tense and the same story also in the past tense. It is repetitive and simple and uses many cognates to make the story comprehensible to adults and children. The stories are intentionally written to be acted out in a class, but also to serve as independent reading in either the present or the past tense. Don Quijote, el ï¿½ltimo caballero is an amusing, ironic and at the same time tragic story. Don Quijote is an ordinary Spaniard with an extraordinary imagination who believes that he must achieve great feats to honor a lady. He falls in love with a waitress that he considers to be the ideal lady. He and his companion Sancho Panza have adventures in which Don Quijote is always mistaken about what he finds along the way while Sancho sees what is really there. The story is based on Miguel de Cervantes The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, published in the 17th century.

Mexico II. California</h2><p>For more than 15 years, Edward Weston kept a diary in which he recorded his struggle to understand himself, his society and his art. His journal has become a classic of photographic literature. Weston was a towering figure in twentieth-century photography, whose restless quest for beauty and the mystical presence behind it resulted in a body of work unrivaled in the medium. John Szarkowski observes that &#x201c;It was as though the things of everyday experience had been transformed... into organic sculptures, the forms of which were both the expression and the justification of the life within... He had freed his eyes of conventional expectation, and had taught them to see the statement of intent that resides in natural form.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Edward Weston </b>(1886-1958) is one of the twentieth century's most prominent and pioneering photographers. In 1917 he became a member of the London Salon and in 1922 he met Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand. <br><br>In 1923 with his marriage failing he went to Mexico and opened a studio. It is at this time that he began keeping journals which he referred to as "daybooks." He wrote in his daybooks until 1943, and in 1961 they were edited by Nancy Newhall and published for the first time.<br><br>He was the first photographer to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship. Sadly, he was stricken with Parkinson's disease in the early 1940s and he relied on his sons, Brett and Cole, to continue printing for him. Cole, his youngest son became his assistant in 1946 and in 1952 the two men put together their father's <i>50th Anniversary Folio</i>. After Edward's death in 1958 Cole fulfilled his father's wish and continued to print his negatives.<br><br><b>Nancy Newhall</b> (1908-1974) dedicated thirty years of her life to photography, as a writer, scholar, critic, editor, and collaborator in publishing the work of several of the most influential photographers of this century.<br><br>Among her many accomplishments are the highly acclaimed exhibitions of Paul Strand and Edward Wilson, which she directed at the Museum of Modern Art. Author of the classic biography of Ansel Adams, <i>The Eloquent Light</i>, she also edited and collaborated with Paul Strand to produce the book <i>Time in New England</i>. Her other books include <i>P.H. Emerson: The Fight for Photography as a Fine Art</i>; <i>Edward Wilson: The Flame of Recognition</i>, (ed); and <i>This Is the American Earth</i> (with Ansel Adams). <br><br><b>Beaumont Newhall</b> (1908-1993) was a distinguished historian and curator, and author of the definitive <i>The History of Photography</i>."It was as though the things of everyday experience had been transformed . . . into organic sculptures, the forms of which were both the expression and the justification of the life within . . .

This beautifully illustrated volume guides readers through all stages of planning and constructing a treehouse. Theyï¿½ll find plans for several different treehouse styles, from a simple but attractive rustic shelter to an arboreal dwelling featuring modern creature comforts with electricity and cooking facilities. The author describes all needed tools, equipment, and materials, and discusses the type of tree most suitable for each of his designs. Readers are guided through construction of platform or foundation, frame, ladders, windows, and doors. They also learn the more complex aspects of construction, such as roofing, staircases, and connecting electricity for lighting and heating. The finished result can range from an idyllic playroom for children to a handsomely furnished space for adult leisure hours or even business conferences. More than 350 handsome color photos show every aspect of treehouse construction.</p><p>back cover<br><i>A Treehouse of Your Own </i> is a comprehensive guide to building the perfect backyard hideaway&#x2014;from planning stages to the finished structure.<br>The world&#x2019;s leading treehouse constructor, John Harris, takes prospective builders through each stage of the build, using detailed step-by-step photography.<br>The book includes a wide variety of amazing structures, showing the different ladders, roofs, rope bridges, balustrades, windows, and accessories you can add to your new treetop home.<br>John Harris is a prize-winning treehouse builder, a medal winner at London&#x2019;s famous Chelsea Flower Show, the author of a previously published book on treehouse construction, and the founder of The TreeHouse Company, a firm that both designs and builds treehouses.British carpenter and author Harris acknowledges that building a Swiss Family Robinson&#x2013;like treetop abode for children is "beyond the carpentry ability of some readers, yet fairly easy for others." His book is awe-inspiring to browse through, as it features breathtaking photos of amazing tree houses, many featuring rope bridges, spiral staircases, arched windows and doors, and verandas. Harris recognizes that every tree&#x2014;and potential tree dweller&#x2014;is unique, so rather than offering sets of fixed plans, he takes a modular approach to building a "treetop retreat," featuring chapters on foundations, roofing, windows and doors, railings, ladders and stairs, and rope bridges. Each of these sections begins with tips for safety, followed by lists of "key objectives" and "equipment and materials," then goes on to describe, in methodical detail, the measuring, cutting, lifting and fastening required to build a structure among the branches of a tree. Harris strives to give "an outline of the sequence of events that should be followed in all treehouse projects," allowing readers to adapt to the shape and size of their tree, their budget and their own carpentry skills. Many color photos offer detailed views of tree houses ranging from simple to deluxe, and while most houses are meant for children, a few are for arboreal dining rooms and home offices, complete with glass windows, electricity and even plumbing. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bill Goldstein's brilliant work will be read with great pleasure not only by those who think they already know his famous subjects, but by all readers who love history and biography.&#x201d; &#x2015;Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of <i>Team of Rivals </i>and <i>The Bully Pulpit</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The World Broke in Two</i> is more fun to read than it has any right to be. Its subject &#x2013; the overlapping neuroses, illnesses, and inspirations of four 20th Century greats &#x2013; would seem familiar territory. But Bill Goldstein is such a companionable writer and his narrative is so full of telling detail that we encounter each of these writers anew. The result is a book that anyone interested in the vicissitudes of the writing life&#x2013; then or now &#x2013; will read with hunger.

He provides new insight into the relationships among writers we thought we knew. How heartening this book will be to readers and to writers &#x2013; it was to me &#x2013; to realize that even Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, and D. H. Lawrence experienced self-doubts, envy, and all kinds of other challenges, and that they simply had to plow through them and get their work done. <i>The World Broke in Two</i> brilliantly illuminates the adventure that is the creative process.&#x201d; &#x2015;Sherill Tippins, author of <i>February House</i> and <i>Inside the Dream Palace:The Life and Times of New York's Legendary Chelsea Hotel</i></p><p>&#x201c;Bill Goldstein, a wizard of words, has gifted us with a magical brew. Profoundly researched and filled with stunning connections, <i>The World Broke in Two </i>is brilliant, compelling, incisive.

While working on his Atomic Energy badge for the Boy Scouts, David&#x2019;s obsessive attention turned to nuclear energy. Throwing caution to the wind, he plunged into a new project: building a nuclear breeder reactor in his backyard garden shed.<br><br>In <b>The Radioactive Boy Scout</b>, veteran journalist Ken Silverstein recreates in brilliant detail the months of David&#x2019;s improbable nuclear quest. Posing as a physics professor, David solicited information on reactor design from the U.S. government and from industry experts. (Ironically, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was his number one source of information.) Scavenging antiques stores and junkyards for old-fashioned smoke detectors and gas lanterns&#x2014;both of which contain small amounts of radioactive material&#x2014;and following blueprints he found in an outdated physics textbook, David cobbled together a crude device that threw off toxic levels of radiation. His unsanctioned and wholly unsupervised project finally sparked an environmental catastrophe that put his town&#x2019;s forty thousand residents at risk and caused the EPA to shut down his lab and bury it at a radioactive dumpsite in Utah.<br><br>An outrageous account of ambition and, ultimately, hubris that sits comfortably on the shelf next to such offbeat science books as Driving Mr. Albert and stories of grand capers like <b>Catch Me If You Can</b>,<b> The Radioactive Boy Scout</b> is a real-life adventure with the narrative energy of a first-rate thriller.</p><p>On June 26, 1995 the people of Golf Manor, Michigan returned from work to find a federal EPA crew dismantling a potting shed in Patty Hahn's back yard. In subsequent days, the crew, wearing protective suits, carted away the refuse in sealed barrels emblazoned with radiation symbols. The EPA workers refused to disclose what was happening, only offering vague reassurance that everything was ok. Ken Silverstein shows that things in Golf Manor were not, in fact, ok. David Hahn, a 17-year-old aspiring Eagle Scout, had constructed the rudiments of a nuclear breeder reactor in his backyard and had contaminated himself and the immediate area with potentially deadly radioactive material. In his brief, briskly-paced account of the events, Silverstein weaves together science, history, and testimony from David and his family in a tale both frightening and tragic. <p> For David to get so far, Silverstein shows, he had to be the victim of carelessness and neglect at all levels of society. David Hahn's parents were divorced, and David used the separate households to conceal the magnitude of his work. His school teachers paid little heed when David, nicknamed Glow Boy by fellow students, suggested he was collecting radioactive substances. Most alarmingly, corporations and government agencies blithely supplied David with the materials and information he needed to expand his work to dangerous levels. Interspersed with his account of David, Silverstein exposes the culture of deceit surrounding the history of nuclear power, a culture that easily seduced an aspiring young scientist. David was left with little in the way of mentorship other than such one-sided testaments to the benefits of science as his trusted <i>Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments</i>. </p><p> The book, which grew out of Silverstein's 1998 story in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> reads like a suspense novel blended with breezy accounts of America's history with the atom. It is, in some ways, a coda for the nuclear age. In his final pages, Silverstein shows that power production from nuclear reactors has slowly ebbed over the last decades, breeder reactors world-wide have been shut down, and public apprehension has finally out-stripped naï¿½ve scientific exuberance for atomic energy. But is the danger truly receding? Surprisingly, <i>The Radioactive Boy Scout</i> does not address any changes in security that have evolved from David's incident. In fact, Silverstein hints that David himself may still be dabbling with radioactive materials. In the post 9/11 era, the prospect is even more frightening. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>KEN SILVERSTEIN</b> is an investigative reporter for the Washington, D.C., bureau of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

At the same time, a soldier named Dimitri is breeding a new Russian dog at a nearby farm. So many dogs were lost in combat, to starvation, and in the slaughter of German dogs that the country is in dire need of every kind of dog.<br> Dimitri, too, has suspicions of Zasha's existance, and would like nothing more than to add her to his breeding program.

The crime scene is most unusual, even for Bryant and May. In a locked bedroom without any trace of fingerprints or blood, the only sign of disturbance is a gruesome life-size puppet of Mr. Punch laying on the floor. Everyone at the party is a suspect, including the corrupt producer, the rakish male lead, the dour set designer, and the assistant stage manager, who is the wild daughter of a prominent government official. <br><br>It&#x2019;s this last fact that threatens the Peculiar Crimes Unit&#x2019;s investigation, as the government&#x2019;s Home Office, wary of the team&#x2019;s eccentric methods, seeks to throw them off the case.

Above his head, a withered yellow corpse hung inside a rusting gibbet iron.<br><br>'Well,' he said, 'this is nice, isn't it?'<br><br>His partner, John May, was not so consoled. The great chamber was freezing. Rain was pattering into an array of galvanised buckets. The smell of mildewed brickwork assailed his nostrils. A few feet behind him, the Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins was stabbing a thin- bladed knife into a screaming priest, looking for the marks of the Devil. On the other side of the detectives stood a torture rack and several members of the Spanish Inquisition clad in crimson robes, armed with flaming brands and scourges.<br><br>'You could have made an effort and put on a clean jacket, instead of that ratty old overcoat,' said May. 'You look like a character from Toad of Toad Hall.'<br><br>'This is Harris Tweed,' said Bryant, fingering a frayed hole in his soup-stained sleeve. 'It was handed down to me by my grandfather.'<br><br>'Was that before or after he passed away?'<br><br>'Funny you should say that. He died in it. Gave himself a heart attack trying to get the lid off a jar of gherkins. My grandmother thought it was a pity to waste good fabric.'<br><br>A distorted tape loop of chanting monks began to play once more from hidden speakers, adding to the chamber's pervasive gloom.<br><br>May sighed. 'Of all the things you've put our Unit through over the years, this has to be the strangest. Hosting a cocktail party in a house of horrors in order to catch a murderer. If you ever say a word about it in your memoirs, I'll kill you.'<br><br>'I didn't hear any better ideas from you,' Bryant reminded him cheerfully. 'This is absolutely our last chance to break the case. At midnight we'll be forced to unlock the doors and we'll lose everything, unless we can flush him out in the next hour. Keep your eyes peeled for anything unusual.'<br><br>May looked around at the kidnapped party guests, most of whom were glumly wedged between rotting corpses. 'Unusual,' he repeated, trying not to lose his temper.<br><br>Bryant sucked the celery stick from his Bloody Mary thoughtfully. Somewhere above the stalactite-spiked arches of London Bridge station a train rumbled. The bricks trembled and soot sifted down. The shunting mingled with the thunder outside. Rain was pouring under the front door and pooling around the sodden shoes of the guests, all of whom were underdressed for the occasion. In the silences between rain, thunder and trains, May saw the group's breath condensing and imagined he could hear their teeth chattering. A waitress passed them, bearing a tray of bloody eyeballs on sticks. On closer inspection, these turned out to be dyed pickled onions.<br><br>'Masks,' said Bryant, apropos of nothing.<br><br>May turned to him. 'Explain?'<br><br>'They're all wearing masks. Look at them all nodding and drinking.' He waved his sausage at the partygoers. 'You wouldn't think we had to bring them here under sufferance and lock them in. They were as jumpy as cats when they arrived, but they're attempting to pretend that everything's normal. Middle-class people with upper-middle incomes. They come alive at parties, no matter how strange the circumstances. They discuss house prices and holidays and restaurants, and give opinions on the plays they've seen. But after all that's happened in the last seven days, they know they've been brought here for another reason. What do you think is happening behind those forced smiles?'<br><br>'I imagine they're morbidly curious, the way people are about watching traffic accidents.'<br><br>'But they're careful to keep up the illusion of appearing unconcerned. An interesting phenomenon, isn't it?'<br><br>'That's the English for you,' said May, studying the gathered guests. 'We're great pretenders.'<br><br>'Yes, an odd mixture of exaggerated politeness and thoughtless cruelty. The true mark of English conversation is not being able to tell when you've been insulted. I think the more sophisticated society becomes, the more it hides behind the masks it manufactures.'<br><br>'Do we have to discuss this now, Arthur? We're on a bit of a deadline here.'<br><br>Bryant ignored his partner. 'It's just that we seem to be so good at hypocrisy. I always think when an Englishman says "We really must get together soon," he's telling you to piss off. We bury ourselves so deeply inside complex personas that it's amazing we remember who we really are. Which makes this room, for example, very hard to read. You know me, I don't play those games. I prefer honesty.'<br><br>'Yes, but you're downright rude to people,' retorted May. 'And I do know you. It's a class thing. This lot make you feel uncomfortable. You're from a working-class background. Your mother cleaned cinemas for a living. You hate the idea that one of the guests might get the better of you tonight.'<br><br>'No,' said Bryant firmly. 'I hate the idea that one of them thinks they can get away with murder.'<br><br>'Well, our legal priority over the investigation ends in exactly'-here May checked his classic Timex-'fifty-five minutes. You're cutting it a tad fine.'<br><br>'I know. We have to watch for the smallest signs, an odd look, any betrayal of emotion that might cause one of them to give the game away.'<br><br>'Arthur, an odd look isn't going to secure a conviction. We need concrete evidence before the clock strikes twelve.'<br><br>'Well, whose idea of a shindig was this?' said a tipsy blond woman in a tight black Lycra dress that had made her tanned breasts rise like golden loaves. She turned her attention to May while ignoring his partner. It was her habit to only address men she found useful or attractive, a trait that made her thoroughly unlikeable.<br><br>'How did you get in?' asked Bryant. 'This is a private party. No riffraff allowed.'<br><br>Rudeness had no effect on Janet Ramsey. As the editor of Hard News, the capital's gossip daily, she was used to having the door metaphorically slammed in her face. 'Actually, Uncle Fester, I'm here as a guest,' she rejoined airily. 'And you're up to something. I can smell it. I can see it on that old tortoise face of yours.'<br><br>'I'm surprised you can see anything through that face-lift,' Bryant harrumphed. 'If you print a single word about this, I'll send so many uniforms around to your office it'll look like you're staging The Pirates of Penzance.'<br><br>Ramsey gave him a blank look.<br><br>'There are a lot of policemen in The Pirates of Penzance,' May explained to her.<br><br>'I don't know why you hang around with Rip Van Winkle here,' said Ramsey, walking frosted fingernails up May's lapel. 'He's holding you back, John. He always has. Tell me the truth. Give an old newspaper gal a break. What's this party all about? Why are the guests locked in? Why does everyone look so anxious? What exactly are you two up to?'<br><br>'You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Janet.'<br><br>'I recognise some of the people in this room.' She narrowed her false eyelashes at the assembly. 'This wouldn't have anything to do with the murders your Unit has been investigating, would it?'<br><br>'You can't print conjecture,' May warned.<br><br>'I see the time has come to let you in on our little secret,' said Bryant, trying not to grimace as he took Ramsey's arm. 'Come with me and I promise all will be revealed.'<br><br>Ramsey knew she couldn't trust Bryant, but her curiosity got the better of her. She stumbled after him, into the chill shadows of the cobwebbed chamber. There was a short silence followed by a yelp and a clang of metal, and Bryant came back alone.<br><br>'What did you do?' asked May. 'Where's Janet?'<br><br>'I think I managed to spike her story,' he said cheerfully. 'I shut her in the Iron Maiden.'<br><br>'That thing's just a stage prop,' said May with a hint of regret. 'There are no sharpened nails on the inside of it.'<br><br>'Really?' Bryant's eyes widened in innocence. 'I had no idea. What a pity. I'll let her out after midnight.'<br><br>'Okay, what do we do now?'<br><br>'We know that our killer is in this room. I just have to come up with a way of drawing him out.'<br><br>'You mean you haven't thought this through?'<br><br>'How could I? From the very first moment, this entire investigation has been an unmitigated disaster. Nothing has gone according to plan.' Bryant peered up his sleeve. 'The little hand's fallen off my watch. How much time do we have left?'<br><br>'Fifty-two minutes. This is the last time all of our suspects will be in one room together. It's the only chance we have to put things right. We're so close now.'<br><br>'John, we're no closer than we were a week ago,' said Bryant. 'God, it feels like we've been working on this case for a lifetime. Come on.'<br><br>The pair set off into the penumbral chamber of horrors, determined to catch an impossible murderer. Last week had felt like a fresh beginning. Now they could see it might have been the beginning of the end.<br><br>TWO<br><br>Clairvoyance<br><br>'A<br><br>fresh start!' said Raymond Land, striding into the Unit's smart new open-plan office in the warehouse at the corner of Caledonian Road. Over the weekend it had been painted arctic white and filled with furniture, admittedly secondhand, but it provided the staff with a communal space.<br><br>Land was pleased to see that the holes in the floor had been repaired. The workmen had almost finished redecorating the building. Broken windows had been replaced. There were no longer bare wires hanging down from the ceiling. There was a door on the toilet and a banister on the staircase. The coffee machine was finally working. The funny smell had gone from the Evidence Room. He slapped his hands together with an approximation of good cheer and beamed hopefully around the place.<br><br>His joy was not reciprocated.<br><br>'What are you so bloody happy about?' asked Jack Renfield, not bothering to look up. The sergeant was crunching indigestion tablets and checking his emails, attacking his keyboard with great bearlike paws.<br><br>Land looked pathetically expectant. 'It's the start of a new week, the sun's out, summer's on the way, nice new paintwork everywhere, we haven't been blamed for anything awful in nearly a month. Makes you feel glad to be alive.'<br><br>'There's a bad storm coming,' said Meera Mangeshkar. 'It's going to be chucking it down by noon. We'll have to put the lights on.'<br><br>Land felt he had every reason to be in a good mood. He and his wife, Leanne, were going on a sailing holiday around the Isle of Wight at the end of the week. His desk had already been cleared in readiness. His monthly budget had been met. The Home Office was leaving him alone. The crime figures were down. Only the staff seemed fed up, but they always looked like that when he came into the room. A more sensitive chap might almost doubt they were pleased to see him.<br><br>'Come on, you lot,' he jeered, 'perk yourselves up a bit. You should be thankful. You've got a nice new office, and the mean streets of King's Cross are quiet for once.'<br><br>'We'd rather be busy,' grumbled Mangeshkar, flicking a rubber band at the cat. Colin Bimsley was making a paper sculpture of a flamingo from old witness statements. Dan Banbury was reading Forensic Analysis in the Home-Volume 4: Drains.<br><br>Land found it hard to share Meera's sentiment. Being busy at the PCU usually meant risking his career, health and sanity. He still fantasized about running a police department in a sleepy Spanish village, the kind of place where the most exciting thing that ever happened was a cow wandering into a shop.<br><br>London was not much smaller than New York but averaged around 130 murders a year, compared with the Big Apple's rate of over 460 in the same period. Most of the London cases were handled by the CID, but the more troublesome crimes were reluctantly placed in the hands of the PCU. Raymond Land had inherited the worst of both worlds; the cases that the Home Office preferred the CID not to handle were the most awkward and unsolvable, and were also the least likely to win public praise for their solution. The PCU received no help from the Met divisions, which meant that they effectively operated in a vacuum.<br><br>Land liked order. He liked graphs and bar charts and Venn diagrams, and Excel spreadsheets of policing figures, even though he didn't really know how to use them. He didn't understand waffling academics and weirdos, and disorganisation and mess, and strange, elliptical ideas that led to investigative dead ends.<br><br>He didn't understand the PCU.<br><br>Sticking his hands into his pockets, he wandered over to the window and sat on the ledge. 'I thought you'd all be happy,' he said plaintively. 'For once, everyone thinks we're doing a good job. You can take it easy. You don't have to spend the week going through someone's rubbish or sitting in a car all night staring at a front door. You can go home at the normal time, catch up on your emails, watch some telly, cook a meal that doesn't come in a plastic tub. For once, you can get on with your lives.'<br><br>But as soon as he said that, Land realized he had made a mistake. Working at the PCU meant surrendering all thoughts of a normal private life. It meant abandoning loved ones, working unsociable hours, falling out with friends, never having time to do the comfortingly habitual things civilians did. His staff barely existed beyond their working lives. Their refrigerators remained empty, their bills piled up, their houseplants died and their voicemails were never played back. Even their pets gave up on them. Apart from a brief, disastrous stay at Raymond Land's house, Crippen had spent his entire nine lives in the office.<br><br>'Well, I feel good about today, and I'm not going to let you lot put the mockers on it,' Land said, rising and turning.<br><br>He looked back and found that suddenly everyone seemed to have brightened up a little. Perhaps his positivity had proved inspirational after all. Bimsley was trying to suppress a laugh. Meera was smiling and shaking her head. 'Right,' said Land, 'we're going to use this week to get organised and learn to behave like a proper police unit.' He looked down to discover a thick arctic white stripe across the seat of his new black trousers. 'You can start by getting the workmen to stick a bloody Wet Paint sign on this ledge.'<br><br>Bimsley burst out laughing.<br><br>A dark thought suddenly crossed Land's mind. 'And where are Bryant and May?' he demanded to know.<br><br>'Look here, can somebody give me a hand with this?'<br><br>Bryant appeared in the doorway right on cue. If Land hadn't known better, he'd have suspected that his most senior detective had been waiting outside to make an entrance. Bryant moved to reveal a crimson- painted wooden case. It was about five feet tall and covered in cobwebs.

Now, with <i>The Surrendered</i>, Lee has created a book that amplifies everything we've seen in his previous works, and reads like nothing else. It is a brilliant, haunting, heartbreaking story about how love and war inalterably change the lives of those they touch. <br><br> June Han was only a girl when the Korean War left her orphaned; Hector Brennan was a young GI who fled the petty tragedies of his small town to serve his country. When the war ended, their lives collided at a Korean orphanage where they vied for the attentions of Sylvie Tanner, the beautiful yet deeply damaged missionary wife whose elusive love seemed to transform everything. Thirty years later and on the other side of the world, June and Hector are reunited in a plot that will force them to come to terms with the mysterious secrets of their past, and the shocking acts of love and violence that bind them together. <br><br> As Lee unfurls the stunning story of June, Hector, and Sylvie, he weaves a profound meditation on the nature of heroism and sacrifice, the power of love, and the possibilities for mercy, salvation, and surrendering oneself to another. Combining the complex themes of identity and belonging of <i>Native Speaker</i> and <i>A Gesture Life</i> with the broad range, energy, and pure storytelling gifts of Aloft, Chang-rae Lee has delivered his most ambitious, exciting, and unforgettable work yet. It is a mesmerizï¿½ing novel, elegantly suspenseful and deeply affecting.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Chang-Rae Lee on <em>The Surrendered</em></strong> <br><br> The inspiration for <em>The Surrendered</em> has its roots in a project I worked on more than twenty years ago, while I was still in college. I was taking a seminar on modern Korean history, and I decided that I would conduct an interview with my father to fulfill the writing assignment, conceiving a reporter-at-large-type piece that would offer personal testimony and narrative set against a historical backdrop. I wasn't sure if he would agree. My father was twelve years old on the eve of the Korean War, and although over the years I had asked him a number of times about his experiences, his responses were typically vague and hurried; he never seemed to want to talk about that time, only briefly mentioning that his sister had died during the war from an untreated bout of pneumonia. But since I was taking a course with a special focus on Korea, he agreed to speak in more detail about that period. <br><br> My father's family was originally from Pyongyang, now the capital of North Korea, and they had joined the throngs of refugees who were heading south in an attempt to get behind the line of American forces. He first recounted a story about his favorite older cousin, who was pregnant and just about to give birth as the rest of the extended family was frantically packing up and leaving. My father was dispatched to tell his cousin that everyone was departing&#x2014;explosions could be heard in the distance&#x2014;yet even though she and her husband desperately wanted to go, she had already started her labors. She couldn&#x2019;t be moved. Everybody soon left, and that was last time the cousin and her husband were seen alive; to this day no one knows what happened to them, whether they perished or survived the war and ended up living in North Korea. <br><br> Telling that story of his cousin seemed to break the grip of something on my father. He recounted again that his sister had died of pneumonia during the refugee march, then added, casually, that in fact his younger brother had died during their travels, too. This disclosure surprised me. I knew that he had lost a brother, this from asking him, as children often will, about how many siblings he had, matching the number against my uncles and aunts, but I remembered his saying that his brother had died in a "subway accident." I didn't think there was a subway in either Pyongyang or Seoul during his childhood, so I asked him when his brother had died, and how. <br><br> My father told me that in fact his brother had been killed not by a subway car but by a boxcar of a train full of refugees. They were among the hundreds who filled the cars. The car holding the rest of their family was packed tight, so he and his brother had to sleep on top of the boxcar. In the middle of the night the train halted violently, and his brother, who was eight years old, fell off, the train then lurching forward for a short distance. My father jumped down and went back and found his brother, whose leg had been amputated by the wheels of the train. My father carried him back to the car, to the rest of their family, as the blood&#x2014;and his life&#x2014;ran out of him. <br><br> I've been haunted by that story since I heard it, not only by the horror of the accident but also by the picture of my father as a boy, a boy who had to experience his brother's death so directly and egregiously. I was struck, too, by how unperturbed my father had always seemed to me, this cheerful, optimistic man who certainly didn't appear to be haunted by anything. But of course this was not quite true. The events of the war had stayed with him, and always would. <br><br> In recent years I began to consider writing a novel about that time, and what happened to my father and his brother kept coming back to me. I finally decided to try to write that scene, wondering whether a larger story might be instituted. Naturally the details changed quite drastically as I began to write, the story expanding in every direction, developing its own world and aims, and soon enough it was not my father's story at all. But the kernel of what had happened grew to become the first chapter of <em>The Surrendered</em>, which for me is not so much a war novel as it is a story concerned with the effects of mass conflict on the human psyche and spirit, the private odysseys that those who have experienced conflict must endure.<br> <p>(Photo of Chang-Rae Lee ï¿½ David Burnett)</p> <br>Chang-rae Lee is the author of <i>Native Speaker</i>, winner of the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for first fiction, <i>A Gesture Life</i>, and <i>Aloft</i>.

Among the people discussed: Italo Svevo, Stefan Zweig, Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Yourcenar, Joseph Roth, Vaslav Nijinsky, Lincoln Kirstein, Jerome Robbins, Martha Graham, Bob Fosse, H. L. Mencken, Dorothy Parker, Susan Sontag, and Philip Roth. <br><br>What unites the book is Acocella&#x2019;s interest in the making of art and in the courage, perseverance, and, sometimes, dumb luck that it requires. <br><br>Here is Acocella on Primo Levi, a chemist who, after the Nazis failed to kill him, wrote Survival in Auschwitz, the noblest of the camp memoirs, and followed it with twelve more books . . . Hilary Mantel, the aspiring young lawyer stuck on a couch with a chronic and debilitating illness, who asked herself, &#x201c;What can one do on a couch?&#x201d; (well, one could write) and went on to become one of England&#x2019;s premier novelists . . . M. F. K. Fisher, who, numb with grief over her husband&#x2019;s suicide, dictated to her sister the witty and classic How to Cook a Wolf . . . Marguerite Yourcenar, the victim of a ten-year writer&#x2019;s block, who found in an old trunk a draft of a forgotten novel and finished the book: Memoirs of Hadrian . . . George Balanchine, who, after losing his family at age nine, survived the Russian Revolution, escaped from the Soviet Union at twenty, was for five years house choreographer for Diaghilev&#x2019;s Ballets Russes, came to the United States with the promise that he could set up a ballet company, and had to wait another fifteen years before being able to establish his extraordinary New York City Ballet . . . And Acocella on Mary Magdalene and Joan of Arc reminds us that saints in the service of their visions&#x2013;like artists in the creation of their art&#x2013;draw power from the very blows of fortune that might be expected to defeat them.</p><p>Joan Acocella is a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, where she covers dance and books.

He would stare straight ahead and utter a low hum and beat time with his hands. People would come up to him and ask him if he was all right. Once, his young daughter, Anne, boarded a bus and found him in that condition among the passengers. She knew better than to disturb him. But when the bus stopped at their gate, she got off with him. He turned to her vaguely and said, "Oh, who is it you wish to see?"<br><br>When I think of what it means to be an artist's child, I remember that story. There are worse fates. But in the artist's household the shifts that the children must endure&#x2014;they can't make noise (he's working), they can't leave on vacation (he hasn't finished the chapter)&#x2014;are combined with a mystique that this is all for some exalted cause, which they must honor even though they are too young to understand it. Furthermore, if the artist is someone of Yeats's caliber, the children, as they develop, will measure themselves against him and come up short. In fact, many artists' children turn out just fine, and grow up to edit their parents' work and live off the royalties. But some do not&#x2014;for example, James Joyce's two children. His son became an alcoholic; his daughter went mad. Carol Loeb Shloss, a Joyce scholar who teaches at Stanford, has just written a book about the latter: <i>Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake</i>.<br><br>Lucia grew up in a disorderly household. Joyce had turned his back on Ireland in 1904, when he was twenty-two. Convinced that he was a genius but that his countrymen would never recognize this, he persuaded Nora Barnacle, his wife-to-be, to sail with him to the Continent. They eventually landed in Trieste, and there, for the next decade or so, he worked as a language teacher and completed <i>Dubliners</i> and <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>. With the publication of <i>Portrait</i>, in 1916, he acquired rich patrons, but until then&#x2014;that is, throughout his children's early years&#x2014;the Joyces were very poor. Some days they went without dinner. Their first child, Giorgio, was born in 1905, a bonny, easy baby, and, furthermore, a boy. Nora adored him till the day she died. Two years after Giorgio came Lucia, a sickly, difficult child, and a girl, with strabismus. (That is, she was cross- eyed. Nora, too, had strabismus, but hers was far less noticeable.) Lucia's earliest memories of her mother were of scoldings. Joyce, on the other hand, loved Lucia, spoiled her, sang to her, but only when he had time. He worked all day and then, on many nights, he went out and got blind drunk. The family was evicted from apartment after apartment. By the age of seven, Lucia had lived at five different addresses. By thirteen, she had lived in three different countries. The First World War forced the Joyces to move to Zurich; after the war, they settled in Paris. As a result, Lucia received a spotty education, during which she was repeatedly left back by reason of having to learn a new language.<br><br>Was she strange from childhood? With people who become mentally ill as adults, this question is always hard to answer, because most witnesses, knowing what happened later, read it back into the early years, and are sure that the signs were already there. Richard Ellmann, the author of the standard biography of Joyce, and Brenda Maddox, in her <i>Nora: A Biography of Nora Joyce</i>, both note that the young Lucia seemed to stare off into space, but the strabismus might account for this. It is also said that she was reticent socially. Although she was talkative at home&#x2014;a "saucebox," her father called her&#x2014;she apparently went through periods when she spoke to few people outside her family. But the language-switching could explain this. A friend of the family described her, in her twenties, as "illiterate in three languages." It was four, actually: German, French, English, and Triestine Italian. The last was her native tongue, the language that her family used at home, not just in Trieste but forever after (because Joyce found it easier on the voice). It was not, however, what people spoke in most of the places where she lived.<br><br>When Lucia was fifteen, she began taking dance lessons, mostly of the new, antiballetic, "aesthetic" variety, and this became her main interest during her teens and early twenties. She started at the Dalcroze Institute in Paris, then moved on to study with the toga-clad Raymond Duncan, Isadora's older brother. Eventually, she hooked up with a commune of young women who occasionally performed, in Paris and elsewhere, as Les Six de Rythme et Couleur. However briefly, Lucia was a professional dancer. She is said to have excelled in <i>sauvage</i> roles. But eventually she left this group, as she left every group. (I count nine dance schools in seven years.) In part, that may have been due to lack of encouragement from her family. Nora reportedly nagged Lucia to give up dancing. According to members of the family, she was jealous of the attention the girl received. As for Joyce, Brenda Maddox says he felt "it was unseemly for women to get on the stage and wave their arms about."<br><br>Finally, after seven years' training in the left wing of dance, Lucia bolted to the right wing, and embarked on a backbreaking course of ballet instruction with Lubov Egorova, formerly of the Maryinsky Theatre, in St. Petersburg. This was a terrible idea. Professional ballet dancers begin their training at around the age of eight. Lucia was twenty-two. She worked six hours a day, but of course she couldn't catch up, and, in her discouragement, she concluded that she was not physically strong enough to be a dancer of any kind&#x2014;a decision, Joyce wrote to a friend, that cost her "a month's tears."<br><br>The loss of her dance career was not the only grief that Lucia suffered in her early twenties. The publication of <i>Ulysses</i>, in 1922, made Joyce a celebrity, and there were plenty of young artistic types in Paris who thought it would be nice to be attached to his family. When Giorgio was in his late teens, an American heiress, Helen Fleischman, laid claim to him; eventually he moved in with her. Lucia, who had been very close to Giorgio, felt abandoned. She was also scandalized. (Fleischman was eleven years older than Giorgio, and married.) Finally, she wondered what she was missing. She decided to find out, and in the space of about two years she was rejected by three men: her father's assistant, Samuel Beckett, who told her he wasn't interested in her in that way; her drawing teacher, Alexander Calder, who bedded her but soon went back to his fiancï¿½e; and another artist, Albert Hubbell, who had an affair with her and then returned to his wife. Lucia became more experimental. She took to meeting a sailor at the Eiffel Tower. She announced that she was a lesbian. During these romantic travails, she became more distressed over her strabismus. She had the eye operated on, but it didn't change. Soon afterward, her pride received another blow: her parents told her that they were going to get married. (Giorgio's marriage to the newly divorced Fleischman had started them thinking about legality and inheritance.) This is how she discovered that they never had been married and that she was a bastard.<br><br>The following year, on Joyce's fiftieth birthday, Lucia picked up a chair and threw it at her mother, whereupon Giorgio took her to a medical clinic and checked her in. "He thereby changed her fate," Shloss writes. That is a strong judgment, but it is true in part, because the minute an emotionally disturbed person is placed in an institution the story enters a new phase, in which we see not just the original problem but its alterations under institutionalization: the effects of drugs, the humiliation of being locked up and supervised, the consequent change in the person's self-image and in other people's image of him or her. For the next three years, Lucia went back and forth between home and hospital. One night in 1933, she was at home when the news came that a United States District Court had declared <i>Ulysses</i> not obscene (which meant that it could be published in the States). The Joyces' phone rang and rang with congratulatory calls. Lucia cut the phone wires&#x2014;"<i>I'm</i> the artist," she said&#x2014;and when they were repaired she cut them again. As her behavior grew worse, her hospitalizations became longer. She went from French clinics to Swiss sanitariums. She was analyzed by Jung. (Briefly&#x2014;she wanted no part of him.) One doctor said she was "hebephrenic," which at that time was a subtype of schizophrenia, describing patients who showed antic, "naughty" behavior. Another diagnostician said she was "not lunatic but markedly neurotic." A third thought the problem was "cyclothymia," akin to manic-depressive illness. At one point in 1935, when she seemed stabler, her parents let her go visit some cousins in Bray, a seaside town near Dublin. There she set a peat fire in the living room, and when her cousins' boyfriends came to call she tried to unbutton their trousers. She also, night after night, turned on the gas tap, in a sort of suicidal game. Then she disappeared to Dublin, where she tramped the streets for six days, sleeping in doorways, or worse. When she was found, she herself asked to be taken to a nursing home.<br><br>Soon afterward, the Joyces put her in an asylum in Ivry, outside Paris. She was twenty-eight, and she never lived on the outside again. She changed hospitals a few times, but her condition remained the same. She was quiet for the most part, though now and then she would go into a tearing rage&#x2014;breaking windows, attacking people&#x2014;and she would be put in a straitjacket until she calmed down. This went on for forty-seven years, until her death, in 1982, at the age of seventy-five.<br>Carol Shloss believes that Lucia's case was cruelly mishandled.

When he comes out, he's going to kill her.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Her family's hostile, she can't trust the cops, and the lawyers won't help. She is entangled in a web of lies and prejudice, hatred and murder.<br><br><b>Jack Reacher never could resist a lady in distress.</b><br><br><b>Although the Jack Reacher novels can be read in any order, <i>Echo Burning</i> is 5th in the series. </b></p><p>Jack Reacher is Spenser before Robert Parker domesticated his Boston PI--in fact, Reacher's even tougher than Hawk. He can inhale and exhale a few times and pump up his muscles so they make a bad character think twice about tangling with him. And he's spent enough time on the right side of the law to know how to operate in the gray zone if that's what it takes to save the fair maiden, punish the bad guys, and right any other wrongs he happens to encounter in the course of his wanderings. <i>Echo Burning</i> is vintage Lee Child, a smartly paced, intricately plotted, and masterfully characterized thriller starring Reacher, the ex-military cop who's so concerned about commitment to anything--a woman, possessions, a permanent address--that he only owns the clothes on his back. But he's the kind of justice-seeking guy you'd want on your side, especially if you were an abused wife trapped in a marriage you can't get out of until, and unless, somebody bumps off your old man. <p> Reacher's sympathetic, but he's not crazy. Nonetheless, he allows himself to be drawn into beautiful Carmen Greer's orbit, which ought to teach a guy not to hitchhike. Agreeing to protect her from the husband who's about to be released from jail and, according to Carmen, who's about to pay her back for tipping off the authorities to the tax fraud that landed him in prison, Reacher moves into the bunkhouse of the Echo, Texas, ranch that's owned by the bigoted, bitter, but powerful Greer family, which despises Carmen because she's Mexican and tolerates her only because she's Sloop Greer's wife and the mother of his child. The expected bloodshed ensues, but it's Sloop, not Carmen, who ends up with a bullet in his head. Reacher's convinced that Carmen acted in self-defense, even after other evidence comes to light that suggests there's more--and less--to her unhappy tale than even her own lawyer believes. This is the best Jack Reacher yet, smart, stylish, and convincing.

The dust jacket has a small chip and a closed tear.</p><p>From the rustic simplicity of wooden cottages to the gaudy glitter of imperial palaces and estates, this intriguingly illustrated survey of Russian houses filters social history through architecture. Timber cathedrals, manor houses (all nationalized after the 1917 revolution), Peter the Great's wartime cabin by the White Sea, eclectic villas of the 19th-century bourgeoisie and fisherfolks's clustered dwellings evoke a panorama of Russian life. The homes of famous people shown here duly reflect their personalities. Words and photos invite us inside Lenin's monastic three-room apartment, the cozy corner flat of Dostoyevski's last years, painter Ilya Repi's hexagonal studio with skylights illuminating the interior, and dwellings of Pushkin, Tolstoy, Gorky, Pasternak, Stanislavsky, Chekhov and Tchaikovsky.

What he doesn't realize is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself.

Whether or not they agree with his legal tactics, most people would agree that he possesses a powerful and profound sense of justice. In this meditation on his profession, Dershowitz writes about life, law, and the opportunities that young lawyers have to do good and do well at the same time.We live in an age of growing dissatisfaction with law as a career, which ironically comes at a time of unprecedented wealth for many lawyers. Dershowitz addresses this paradox, as well as the uncomfortable reality of working hard for clients who are often without many redeeming qualities. He writes about the lure of money, fame, and power, as well as about the seduction of success. In the process, he conveys some of the &#34;tricks of the trade&#34; that have helped him win cases and become successful at the art and practice of &#34;lawyering.&#34;</p><p><b>Alan Dershowitz</b> is Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Known as a defense lawyer, he is also a litigator, columnist, lecturer, book reviewer, and prolific author. His recent books include Sexual McCarthyism, on the Starr investigation, and Reasonable Doubts, on the O. J. Simpson case. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Dershowitz helps inaugurate a new series called the Art of Mentoring with this volume of advice and reflection on practicing law. Several unifying themes run throughout, most prominently the ethical traps for defense attorneys, prosecutors and even judges inherent in the practice of criminal law. Dershowitz alerts a fledgling lawyer to the systemic bias, corner-cutting and outright cheating that he sees permeating the criminal courts. While Dershowitz recognizes the ethical ambiguity that suffuses much of the law, he is more concerned with communicating the moral absolutes he believes in. These include the uncompromising obligation of a defense lawyer to work for the accused's acquittal by all legitimate means. A believer in telling the truth, Dershowitz excoriates deceitful lawyers and hypocritical judges alike. Along with the moral imperatives, the author tells some war stories and settles a few scores, for example, with critics who took him to task for defending O.J. Simpson, and with the Supreme Court, whose decision in the 2000 election case Dershowitz finds dishonest and unprincipled. The young lawyer (to whom these mini-essays are addressed) will perceive how ethically messy and complicated the law can be and how many core issues in our national life the law touches. Even more, the reader will come away with a sense of Dershowitz himself as teacher, tenacious advocate and self-described provocateur. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Manual of Rendering With Pen and Ink (The Thames and Hudson Manuals)</h2><p>A guide to the techniques and equipment used in perspective drawing, the drawing of transport, plants, rocks, water, and more</p><p></p><h2>Trouble in Spades: A Nina Quinn Mystery</h2><p><p>Landscaping is Nina Quinn's business, but trouble seems to be her middle name.

The path is vague, however, and certainly treacherous as it takes him into strange territories that, quite literally, no one has ever seen before. The task is too dangerous to venture upon alone, so he must seek assistance, comrades for the coming travails.</p><p>So assisted&#x2015;ably and otherwise&#x2015;by his vampiric brother, Horst, and by the kindly accompaniment of a criminologist and a devil, he will encounter ruins and diableries, mystery and murder, the depths of the lowest pit and a city of horrors. London, to be exact.</p><p>Yet even though Cabal has risked such peril believing he understands the dangers he faces, he is still underestimating them. He is walking into a trap of such arcane complexity that even the one who drew him there has no idea of its true terrors. As the snare closes slowly and subtly around them, it may be that there will be no survivors at all.</p><p><i>The Fall of the House of Cabal </i>is the fifth book in Jonathan L.

It offers a vast tapestry of the intrigues and rivalries of court life, as well as an exquisitely detailed portrayal of a decaying aristocracy.</p><p>In the eleventh century Murasaki Shikibu, a lady in the Heian court of Japan, wrote the world's first novel. But The Tale of Genji is no mere artifact. It is, rather, a lively and astonishingly nuanced portrait of a refined society where every dalliance is an act of political consequence, a play of characters whose inner lives are as rich and changeable as those imagined by Proust. Chief of these is "the shining Genji," the son of the emperor and a man whose passionate impulses create great turmoil in his world and very nearly destroy him. This edition, recognized as the finest version in English, contains a dozen chapters from early in the book, carefully chosen by the translator, Edward G.

He is the former husband of Kate McGarrigle and Suzzy Roche, and father of Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Lucy Wainwright Roche, and Lexie Kelly Wainwright. With a career spanning more than four decades, Wainwright has established himself as one of the most enduring singer-songwriters who emerged from the late 1960s. Not only does he perform regularly across America and in Europe, but he is a sought-after actor, having appeared in many movies and TV series.<br><br> There is probably no singer-songwriter who has so blatantly inserted himself into his songs. The songs can be laugh-out-loud funny, but they also can cut to the bone. In this memoir, Wainwright details the family history his lyrics have referenced and the fractured relationships among generations: the alcoholism, the infidelities, the competitiveness&#x2014;as well as the closeness, the successes, and the joy. Wainwright reflects on the experiences that have influenced his work, including boarding school, the music business, swimming, macrobiotics, sex, incarceration, and something he calls Sir Walter Raleigh Syndrome.<br><br> Wainwright writes poignantly about being a son&#x2014;a status that dominates many of his songs&#x2014;but also about being a parent, a brother, and a grandfather. His lyrics are featured throughout the book, amplifying his prose and showing the connections between the songs and real life. Wainwright also includes selections from his father&#x2019;s brilliant <i>Life</i> magazine columns&#x2014;and, in so doing, reestablishes his father as a major essayist of his era. A funny and insightful meditation on family, inspiration, and art, <i>Liner Notes</i> will thrill fans, readers, and anyone who appreciates the intersection of music and life.</p><p><b>Loudon Wainwright III</b> is a singer-songwriter and actor. In 1968 he began to write songs, and in 1969 recorded his first album. Wainwright has recorded twenty-seven albums, including his 2010 Grammy Award&#x2013;winning <i>High, Wide, &amp; Handsome</i>. His songs have been covered by Johnny Cash, Mose Allison, Rufus Wainwright, Bonnie Raitt, and Earl Scruggs, among others. As an actor he has appeared on TV (<i>M*A*S*H</i>, <i>Ally McBeal</i>, <i>Undeclared</i>), in movies (<i>Big Fish</i>, <i>The Aviator</i>, <i>Knocked Up</i>), on Broadway (<i>Pump Boys and Dinettes</i>) and Off (<i>Hot Lunch Apostles</i>, <i>Surviving Twin</i>). &#x201c;Mr. Wainwright wrings more human truth out of his contradiction than any other songwriter of his generation.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i>, Stephen Holden1.<br><br> my cool life<br><br> Once upon a time there were songwriters and there were singers. The former wrote for the latter and the labor was usually divided rather than singular. Richard wrote the tune and Oscar wrote the lyrics. George did the music, brother Ira was in charge of the words. There were legendary musical tag teams: Gilbert and Sullivan, Comden and Green, Lerner and Loewe. Occasionally you'd get a genius who did it all-words and music-creative switch-hitters like Frank Loesser and Irving Berlin, but in Tin Pan Alley it was usually a two-person endeavor. And that continued right up into rock and roll. Goffin and King, Leiber and Stoller, Lennon and McCartney (or vice versa, as McCartney would now have it). Of course, Paul and John had themselves in mind as the singers and protagonists of their songs, in the same way that their hero Chuck Berry wrote and sang about his cool life. When John warbled, "I once had a girl / Or should I say she once had me," you felt sure that he was the actual guy being had. In traditional folk, blues, and country, few songwriters, if any, could read or write music. They made up songs about what was happening to and around them and then they had the audacity to sing and play the stuff themselves, using guitars, banjos, and harmonicas for self-accompaniment. These were the first singer-songwriters I heard on records, pioneers like Huddie Ledbetter, Robert Johnson, Woody Guthrie, Jimmie Rodgers, and Hank Williams. Guys with guitars telling it like it was. The "it" in question was the life they led. They spilled the beans and gave up the gory details. As a listener you felt you were getting something at its source, something simple, direct, and easy to identify with, because it turned out that their beans were not unlike your own. Everybody has pretty much the same gory details, which is why autobiography, and art, for that matter, work.<br><br> When I saw Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963, there was a whole lotta identification going on. Here was a guy just a few years older than I was, writing and singing about what was happening in the world-his world and mine. These were the heady days of "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are A-Changin'," when there were social issues to sing about and apostrophes in song titles. The not-so-nice Jewish boy from Hibbing, Minnesota, sounded like a sixty-year-old black bluesman who'd listened to a ton of Woody Guthrie, but Bob was young and just searching for himself. On his first recordings, Ray Charles all but impersonates his hero Nat King Cole. By the time Dylan went and, for that matter, became electric two years later at Newport, he'd become a fully formed original who'd left his contemporaries and his own influences in the dust. After 1965, Bob seemed to be pretty much focused on his cool, albeit rather cryptic, life. It had gone from "Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen" to "You got a lotta nerve / To say you are my friend," which for my money is going from good to even better.<br><br> So what's the big rule/clich&#x17d; when it comes to writing? Write about what you know? When I started writing songs in 1968 I didn't know about much. Raised in an affluent suburb of New York City, I'd gone to a boys' boarding school, dropped out of college, been busted for pot, and had survived a few disastrous puppy-love affairs. I'd mowed some lawns and had hitchhiked to New Canaan, Connecticut, but I hadn't harvested a single bale of cotton or ridden any rails. Still, I somehow managed to write two or three songs per week, drawn from my pathetic dearth of experience. Like most serious, young, egotistical artists, I thought my life, though yet to be cool, was nonetheless interesting. At least I was smart enough to know I had to make it seem interesting. So I put some work into presentation. To separate myself from the pack of bell-bottomed, ponytailed, guitar-toting song-slingers, I wore khakis and Brooks Brothers shirts and kept my hair unfashionably short. To cope with coffeehouse stage fright, while performing I physicalized my fear into strange, jerky body gyrations, replete with leg lifts, facial grimaces, and lots of tongue wagging. I was trying to make sure people noticed me and, within a year, Atlantic Records did. I made my first two albums for them. The records were positively retro, unadorned, without a trace of the drums, bass, and tasteful pedal-steel-guitar lickage that was going around at the time. My instincts paid off, at least for the critics, who were always looking for the next new thing and desperate to fill the Dylan vacuum (Bob was out of commission at that time, holed up in Woodstock, recovering from a motorcycle accident). I was, to shamelessly quote one hyperbolic journalist, "a blinding new talent." All my work on packaging had paid off. I'd been noticed. The songs I had written were also good. That helped. Once I began in earnest, I also decided to stop listening to the competition. I didn't want to check out this new guy David Bowie or hear what Dylan's latest was. I put an embargo on any and all incoming influences, because I sensed it was important to be original, to not be like anyone else. If I was in a car and another singer-songwriter came on the radio, I'd turn it off or go looking for the jazz station. People always want to know what I listen to. My answer to that question has been and continues to be "Dead black piano players."<br><br> But nobody writes or works in a vacuum. There's a market out there, and unless you're writing, singing, shipbuilding, basket weaving, or whatever for the sheer pleasure of it, you have to deal with that market and all its vagaries. Since I've been in the music business I've earned a good enough living, mostly toiling away on the biz's outer peripheries. I've never written my songs for other people to sing and/or record, and, although I've had a few "covers" as they call them in the biz (a term that brings to my mind Hudson's Bay blankets), there haven't been a lot of publishing royalty checks over the last forty-five years. I made fun of this rather sad fact in a song called, brace yourself, "A Song." The opening lines are:<br><br> Here's a song for someone else to sing<br><br> With a universal and generic ring<br><br> It's all about the same old stuff<br><br> That you like and can't get enough of<br><br> How's about a minor chord right here?<br><br> Wasn't that rather pleasant in your ear?<br><br> -"A Song," 1997<br><br> In 1972, after releasing my two critically acclaimed but largely unpurchased LPs, Atlantic's crush on me was over and I was dropped. I was then picked up (yet another weird term, this one connotative of prostitution) by Columbia Records. On my third record, imaginatively titled Album III, there were more songs of inexperience and autobiographical angst, but also a novelty tune I had made up in twelve minutes about a dead skunk I had run over while driving in northern Westchester County, New York. Dumb luck, great karma, plus some good old-fashioned payola all combined in a perfect storm, and the result was my only hit heretofore, number twelve on the Billboard chart and number one in Little Rock, Arkansas, for six weeks. Suddenly, I did have a pretty cool life. I was the "Dead Skunk" guy.<br><br> Twenty-five years old and I pretty much had made it. The critics' darling was now a success. So what happened? Why is it that many people aren't quite sure who the hell I actually am? Where were the follow-up hits to "Dead Skunk," funny animal songs like "I Met Her at the Pet Store" and "Stay Away from My Aardvark"? I have bored a number of psychotherapists while coming up with answers to some of these questions and have chronicled quite a few of my resentments in song.<br><br> They spelled my name wrong again<br><br> With an E between the D and the N.<br><br> Some dope didn't know it should be an O.<br><br> They spelled my name wrong again.<br><br> -"T.S.M.N.W.A.," 1993<br><br> I continued to write about my life as it went all the way from cool to cheesy. By 1973, despite or possibly due to having had a hit song, I was miserable. Married and the father of two small children, I was never home, drunk a good deal of the time, and apparently felt it necessary to sleep with every waitress in North America and the United Kingdom. These beans have been spilt in song: "Mr. Guilty," "Drinking Song," and "The Waitress Song," to name three of dozens.<br><br> Now we've stumbled onto one of the big important questions: Is it necessary to feel like shit in order to be creative? I'd say the answer is, unless you're J. S. Bach, yes. Or to put it another way: It may not be necessary to feel like shit, but it couldn't hurt.<br><br> I know that those legit guys I mentioned earlier-Oscar, Richard, Irving, and Frank-had the blues from time to time, but when they wrote about it and got Ethel Merman or John Raitt to sing it, you felt sorry for Ethel and John, not for Oscar and Frank. I suppose that was the idea; the remove was placed there intentionally. Less messy, I guess. But I also know that when Hank Williams sings his very own "Hear that lonesome whippoorwill / He sounds too blue to fly," it's powerful and I doubt if Ethel, John, or even Sinatra could top his version. The very names of the legendary blues and R&amp;B singer-songwriters tell it like they were: Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Lightnin' Hopkins, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Mississippi John Hurt. These were performers and writers who were out to advertise their personas. They were musical memoirists. Autobiography was central to their ability to communicate not just their message but the emotion behind their message.<br><br> About twenty-five years ago, I wrote a song called "Hitting You." It was about hauling off and smacking one of my kids too hard. On the butt, I hasten to add. Nevertheless, she was five and I shouldn't have hit her. People were shocked when they heard the song, and some said I was very brave to sing it onstage. That's nice to hear, but I wasn't being brave. A stage-whether in a club, a concert hall, or a cow pasture-is usually a safe place for a performer. You appear to be exposed, but the reality is you're protected. There are lights, microphones, and often a fourth invisible wall separating you from the mob, a mob that hopefully happens to be partial to you. If you know what you're doing, you can get away with murder. And that, figuratively speaking, can be your intention. I've always held that provocation, unless totally gratuitous, is a good thing. Sometimes, like Barry Manilow, I write the songs that make the whole world cry, but often the response I'm going for is a shiver or a cringe. Making an audience uncomfortable for limited amounts of time ratchets up the dramatic tension. You then have the option to release that tension when and how you deem appropriate. Sounds like a bit of a cat-and-mouse game, doesn't it? I'm sure you've seen show biz movies where the performer states his desire and need to go out there and "kill 'em" or "knock 'em dead." Doing a show, or one's act as they used to call it, is a bit like cooking or sex. It's best not to hurry. Or so I've been told. Repeatedly.<br><br> Occasionally I get a reaction to a song that's not the one I expected. I assumed that people who heard "Hitting You" would be affected by their recollections of being whacked in the backseat by their own dads, and indeed some were, but many, if not most, identified not with the one being hit, but with the hitter. People came up after shows and talked to me about how they'd lost it and hit their kids and how awful and guilty they still felt about it. Now, that's entertainment!<br><br> Frequently I'm asked if writing and singing such personal songs is in any way therapeutic. It's true I have had people thank me for writing certain songs, usually ones about family, the passage of time, and death, just a few of my favorite topics (along with snowflakes on lashes and whiskers on kittens). I'm always happy to help someone, particularly a paying customer, make it through the night. As to whether what I do is therapeutic for myself, I doubt it. My career has provided me with a living and a half-assed identity, but having those things hasn't resolved any of my so-called stuff. I don't think songwriting is curative. In fact, it could be argued that, in the end, singing the blues just makes you bluer.<br><br> I never wanted to be a writer. It seemed like a hard, boring, and lonely life. Growing up, I saw my journalist father at work torturing himself while writing, trying to write, and, worst of all, not writing.<br><br> Being a writer looked to me like a stone drag and a must to avoid. By the time I was seven I knew that singing and performing would be part of my life equation. But I was surprised when wordplay entered the picture fifteen years later and I started writing my songs. Caressing a curvaceous guitar and singing my little ditties was nowhere near as lonely as trying to fill up blank pieces of paper. It was spare-time stuff, easy and fun. Unlike what my dad was doing, songwriting was quick. Who ever heard of a song (other than a Leonard Cohen song) taking six months or two years to write? In the end, I got to be like my old man, but in my own way, and for guys, that's hitting the Oedipal jackpot, like making out with your mom without having to actually do it.<br><br> But I don't want you to think I'm totally well-adjusted. Or ungrateful. My father loved writing and knew it was important, and I think I inherited some of that love and knowledge. The primary techniques I use in my work are description and detail. These are journalistic techniques, genetically passed on to me from my progenitor, and I use them in combination with sprinklings of humor, dollops of irony, and great lashings of unreliable narration.<br><br> When I first began writing, my songs were coming at a rate of two or three per week. Sadly, almost nothing comes at that rate anymore. But when you're young, you're full of it and it pours out of you-piss and vinegar, fire and brimstone, and my personal favorites, Sturm und Drang. Later, the output slows down, and eventually you're left with just a trickle. If this is getting a little too urogenital for you, let's switch metaphors. Fishing. Writing songs is like fishing. You sit in the boat and you wait. It's true you have to know the best spot, time of day, what bait to use, the difference between a nibble and a strike, and most important, how to get the damn fish into the boat. Talent is essential, craft is crucial, but for me it's mostly down to waiting and luck. And in my line of work, luck is not random. It's definite and discerning. It's invisible, but it's there. It's mysterious and also obvious. I don't understand how inspiration works and I don't want to. Don't mess with grace and divinity. You can write songs with hard work, sharp pencils, and a rhyming dictionary, but without luck they won't swing. No luck means no fish.</p><h2>Pantone: Sticker Book with Posters</h2><p>Twenty-one pages of stickers and six double-sided pull-out posters will excite children and PANTONE-loving adults alike!

As founding fathers, they risked their lives for American independence, but they also wanted more. Each wished for profound changes in the political and social fabric of pre-1776 America and hoped that the American Revolution would spark republican and egalitarian revolutions throughout Europe, sweeping away the old monarchical order. Ultimately, each rejoiced at the opportunity to be a part of the French Revolution, a cause that became untenable as idealism gave way to the bloody Terror.</p><p><i>Apostles of Revolution</i> spans a crucial period in Western Civilization ranging from the American insurgency against Great Britain to the Declaration of Independence, from desperate engagements on American battlefields to the threat posed to the ideals of the Revolution by the Federalist Party. With the French Revolution devolving into anarchy in the background, the era culminates with the &#x201c;Revolution of 1800,&#x201d; Jefferson's election as president. </p><p>Written as a sweeping narrative of a pivotal epoch, <i>Apostles of Revolution</i> captures the turbulent spirit of the times and the personal dangers experienced by Jefferson, Paine, and Monroe. It reminds us that the liberty we take for granted is ours only because we, both champions and common citizens, have fought for it.</p></p><p><b>John Ferling </b>is professor emeritus of history at the University of West Georgia. He is the author of many books on American Revolutionary history, including <i>The Ascent of George Washington</i>; <i>Almost a Miracle</i>, an acclaimed military history of the War of Independence; and the award-winning <i>A Leap in the Dark</i>. His most recent book on American history is <i>Whirlwind: The American Revolution and the War That Won It</i>. He and his wife, Carol, live near Atlanta, Georgia.<p>"Another winner of early American history from a renowned practitioner." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Ferling brings the political struggles of his subjects to life, enriching readers both familiar and unfamiliar with the period&#x2019;s history with discussion of the now-obscure Federalist schemes to deny Jefferson the presidency in 1800. By noting present-day parallels to the risks that 19th-century oligarchs posed to democracy, Ferling has produced the best kind of popular history, one that illuminates why remembering the past is vital for the present." - <i>Starred review, Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Ferling, a prolific and accomplished historian . . . compels his readers' interest . . A sophisticated view of revolutionary times on both sides of the Atlantic." - <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"This compelling narrative will appeal to both scholarly and popular 18th ï¿½century history enthusiasts as well as those who value representative government." - <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"[Ferling] covers Jefferson, Thomas Paine and James Monroe in a comparative biography . . . Artfully written chapters sketch their lives (birth to death), political careers, and publications. Summing up: Recommended." - <i>CHOICE</i></p><p>"Once again, John Ferling has written an illuminating, insightful and absorbing study of the 18th-century age of Revolution. In <i>Apostles of Revolution</i>, he brings Jefferson, Paine and Monroe to life as they pursue, on two continents, their Enlightenment dreams of democracy and universal rights." - <i>Susan Dunn, author of SISTER REVOLUTIONS: FRENCH LIGHTING, AMERICAN LIGHT</i></p><p>"John Ferling is brilliant to perceive that overlapping the stories of Jefferson, Paine, and Monroe brings these revolutionaries into sharper focus. Their goal wasn't just American independence. Each sought a new world for all mankind." - <i>Robert M. S. McDonald, United States Military Academy, author of CONFOUNDING FATHER</i></p><p>"This close-up, even intimate, view of three amazing personalities, engaged in a web of dangerous action, throws unexpected new light on the progress of the entire Revolutionary generation. Ferling's deep experience in founding history, and in storytelling, has him at the top of his game here. A powerful achievement--and a great read." - <i>William Hogeland, author of AUTUMN OF THE BLACK SNAKE: THE CREATION OF THE U.S. ARMY AND THE INVASION THAT OPENED THE WEST</i></p><p>"John Ferling's latest engagement with the trials and triumphs of the American Revolutionary generation focuses in on the big questions: What makes a revolution just? And what can be expected to emerge when a revolution successfully concludes? This time the story is told through the combined writings and actions of three whose striving to preserve their ideals comes at a cost." - <i>Andrew Burstein and Nancy Isenberg, coauthors of MADISON AND JEFFERSON</i></p><p>"Ferling&#x2019;s three &#x201c;apostles&#x201d; &#x2015; Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe &#x2015; had in common their efforts to spread revolution not only in America but also in France . . . all three hoped and worked for a society that was more democratic and more egalitarian. Paine and Monroe lived together for a stretch, as did Monroe and Jefferson, and the three men very much admired and appreciated what each brought to their shared cause. By following their intertwined lives, Ferling illuminates their early successes in America, their ultimate disillusionments in France and their subsequent re-dedication to spreading democracy in America." - <i>Trend &amp; Tradition</i></p><p>"Ferling&#x2019;s vivid descriptions will compel you to read this treasure repeatedly." - <i>San Francisco Book Review on WHIRLWIND</i></p><p>"A nuanced study of the American Revolution . . . accomplished scholar [John] Ferling employs his extensive knowledge . . . A first-rate historian's masterful touch conveys the profound changes to colonists' 'hearts and minds.' " - <i>Starred review, finalist for 2015 Book Prize, "Best Books of 2015", Kirkus Reviews on WHIRLWIND</i></p><p>"[A]n objective history . . .

It was more than thirty hours since he had taken off from Oslo via London, and after the change of planes in Bahrain he had sat in the same bloody seat by the emergency exit.

He drove Harry to King&#x2019;s Cross, holding forth the whole way: this area was Sydney&#x2019;s red-ï¿½light district and the center for the drugs trade and to a large extent all the other shady dealings in town. Every second scandal seemed to have a connection with some hotel or strip joint inside this square kilometer.<br><br>&#x201c;Here we are,&#x201d; Andrew said suddenly. He pulled in to the curb, jumped out and took Harry&#x2019;s suitcase from the boot.<br><br>&#x201c;See you tomorrow,&#x201d; Andrew said, and with that he and the car were gone. With a stiff back and jet lag beginning to announce its presence, Harry and his suitcase were now alone on a pavement in a town boasting a population roughly equivalent to the whole of Norway, outside the splendid Crescent Hotel. The name was printed on the door next to three stars. Oslo&#x2019;s Chief Constable was not known for largesse with regards to accommodation for her employees. But perhaps this one was not going to be too bad after all. There must have been a civil service discount and it was probably the hotel&#x2019;s smallest room, Harry reflected.<br><br>And it was.<br><br>2<br><br>Gap Park<br><br>Harry knocked warily on the door of the Head of Crime Squad for Surry Hills.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; boomed a voice from inside.<br><br>A tall, broad man with a stomach designed to impress was standing by the window, behind an oak desk. Beneath a thinning mane protruded gray bushy eyebrows, but the wrinkles around his eyes smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;Harry Holy from Oslo, Norway, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take a pew, Holy. You look bloody fit for this time of the morning. I hope you haven&#x2019;t been to see any of the boys in Narc, have you?&#x201d; Neil McCormack let out a huge laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;Jet lag. I&#x2019;ve been awake since four this morning, sir,&#x201d; Harry explained.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Just an in-ï¿½joke. We had a pretty high-ï¿½profile corruption case here a couple of years back, you see. Ten officers were convicted, among other things for selling drugs&#x2014;to one another. Suspicion was raised because a couple of them were so alert&#x2014;round the clock. No joke ï¿½really.&#x201d; He chuckled contentedly, put on his glasses and flicked through the papers in front of him.<br><br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ve been sent here to assist us with our investigation into the murder of Inger Holter, a Norwegian citizen with a permit to work in Australia. Blonde, good-ï¿½looking girl, according to the photos. Twenty-ï¿½three years old, wasn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry nodded. McCormack was serious now.<br><br>&#x201c;Found by fishermen on the ocean side of Watson&#x2019;s Bay&#x2014;to be more precise, Gap Park. Semi-ï¿½naked. Bruising suggested she had been raped first and then strangled, but no semen was found. Later transported at the dead of night to the park where the body was dumped off the cliff.&#x201d;<br><br>He pulled a face.<br><br>&#x201c;Had the weather been a little worse the waves would definitely have carried her out, but instead she lay among the rocks until she was found. As I said, there was no semen present, and the reason for that is that the vagina was sliced up like a filleted fish and the seawater did a thorough job of washing this girl clean. Therefore we have no fingerprints either, though we do have a rough estimate of time of death . . .&#x201d; McCormack removed his glasses and rubbed his face. &#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t have a murderer. And what the hell are you gonna do about that, Mr. Holy?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry was about to answer but was interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;What you&#x2019;re gonna do is watch carefully while we haul the bastard in, tell the Norwegian press along the way what a wonderful job we&#x2019;re doing together&#x2014;making sure we don&#x2019;t offend anyone at the Norwegian Embassy, or relatives&#x2014;and otherwise enjoy a break and send a card or two to your dear Chief Constable. How is she by the way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, as far as I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great woman, she is. I s&#x2019;pose she explained to you what&#x2019;s expected of you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To some extent. I&#x2019;m taking part in an invest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great. Forget all that. Here are the new rules. Number one: from now on you listen to me, me and me alone. Number two: you don&#x2019;t take part in anything you haven&#x2019;t been instructed to do by me. And number three: one toe out of line and you&#x2019;ll be on the first plane home.&#x201d;<br><br>This was delivered with a smile, but the message was clear: paws off, he was here as an observer. He might just as well have brought his swimming things and a camera along.<br><br>&#x201c;I gather that Inger Holter was some kind of TV celeb in Norway?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A minor celeb, sir. She hosted a children&#x2019;s program broadcast a couple of years ago. I suppose before this happened she was on her way into oblivion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;ve been told that your papers are making a big thing of this murder. Couple of them have sent people here already. We&#x2019;ve given &#x2019;em what we&#x2019;ve got, and that&#x2019;s not a great deal, so they&#x2019;ll soon be bored and bugger off home. They don&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;re here. We&#x2019;ve got our own nannies, so you won&#x2019;t have to take care of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for that, sir,&#x201d; Harry said, and he meant it. The thought of panting Norwegian journalists looking over his shoulder was not a welcome one.<br><br>&#x201c;OK, Holy, I&#x2019;ll be honest with you and tell you how the land lies. I&#x2019;ve been told in no uncertain terms by my governor that councillors in Sydney would like to see this case cleared up as soon as possible. As usual, it&#x2019;s all about politics and dosh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dosh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we reckon unemployment in Sydney will rise to over ten percent this year, and the town needs every cent we can get from the tourists. We&#x2019;ve got the Olympic Games just round the corner, in 2000, and tourism from Scandinavia&#x2019;s on the up. Murder, especially one which hasn&#x2019;t been cleared up, isn&#x2019;t a good advert for the town, so we&#x2019;re doing what we can. We have a team of four detectives on the case plus high-ï¿½priority access to the force&#x2019;s resources&#x2014;all the computers, forensic staff, lab people. And so on.&#x201d;<br><br>McCormack pulled out a sheet of paper which he studied with a frown.<br><br>&#x201c;In fact, you should be working with Watkins, but since you specifically asked for Kensington, I see no reason to refuse your request.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, to my knowledge I haven&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kensington&#x2019;s a good man. There are not many Indigenous officers who have come up through the ranks like him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br><br>McCormack shrugged. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just the way it is. Well, Holy, if there&#x2019;s anything else, you know where I hang out. Any questions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er, just a formality, sir. I was wondering whether sir was the right mode of address to a superior officer in this country, or whether it was a little too . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Formal? Stiff? Yes, I guess it probably is. But I like it. It reminds me that I am in fact the boss of this outfit.&#x201d; McCormack burst out laughing and concluded the meeting with a bone-ï¿½crunching handshake.<br><br>&#x201c;January&#x2019;s the tourist season in Australia,&#x201d; Andrew explained as they lurched forward in the traffic around Circular Quay.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone comes to see the Sydney Opera House and go on boat trips round the harbor and admire the women on Bondi Beach. Shame you&#x2019;ve got to work.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry shook his head. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter. I break out in a cold sweat around tourist traps.&#x201d;<br><br>They emerged onto New South Head Road, where the Toyota sped eastward to Watson&#x2019;s Bay.<br><br>&#x201c;The East Side of Sydney&#x2019;s not exactly like the East End of London,&#x201d; Andrew explained as they passed one fashionable house after another. &#x201c;This district&#x2019;s called Double Bay. We call it Double Pay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where did Inger Holter live?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She lived with her boyfriend in Newtown for a while before they split up and she moved to a little one-ï¿½room flat in Glebe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boyfriend?&#x201d;<br><br>Andrew shrugged. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s Australian, a computer engineer and met her when she came here on holiday two years ago. He&#x2019;s got an alibi for the night of the murder and is not exactly the prototype of a murderer. But you never know, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>They parked below Gap Park, one of Sydney&#x2019;s many green lungs. Steep stone steps led up to the windblown park that lay high above Watson&#x2019;s Bay to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The heat hit them when they opened the car doors. Andrew put on a big pair of shades, which made Harry think of a laid-ï¿½back porn king. For some reason his Australian colleague was wearing a tight suit today, and Harry thought the broad-ï¿½shouldered black man looked a bit comical as he rolled and pitched up the path in front of him to the viewpoint.<br><br>Harry looked around. To the west he saw the city center with the Harbor Bridge, to the north the beach and yachts in Watson&#x2019;s Bay and, further in the distance, verdant Manly, the suburb on the northern side of the bay. To the east the horizon curved in a spectrum of various shades of blue. The cliffs plunged down in front of them, and way below the ocean breakers ended their long voyage in a thunderous crescendo among the rocks.<br><br>Harry felt a bead of sweat running down between his shoulder blades. This heat was giving him goose pimples.<br><br>&#x201c;You can see the Pacific Ocean from here, Harry. Next stop New Zealand, after about twelve hundred wet miles,&#x201d; Andrew said, spitting a thick gobbet off the edge of the cliff. They followed it down for a while until the wind dispersed it.<br><br>&#x201c;Good job she wasn&#x2019;t alive when she fell,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She must have hit the cliffs on the way down; there were large chunks of flesh torn from her body when they found her.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf</h2><p>One of John Muir&#x2019;s best-loved books, this volume largely comprises diary entries he made during his memorable 1867 trek from Louisville, Kentucky, to Florida. Timeless observations of the natural world mingle with a vivid look at the post Civil War South, encounters with colorful or desperate characters, and an archetypal portrait of a young man in search of himself.</p><p>n Muir, age twenty-eight, was blinded in an industrial accident. He lay in bed for two weeks wondering if he would ever see again. When his sight miraculously returned, Muir resolved to devote all his time to the great passion of his life -- studying plants. He quit his job in an Indiana manufacturing plant, said good-bye to his family, and set out alone to walk to the Gulf of Mexico, sketching tropical plants along the way. He kept a journal of this thousand-mile walk and near the end of his life, now famous as a conservation warrior and literary celebrity, sent a typescript of it to his publisher. The result is a wonderful portrait of a young man in search of himself and a particularly vivid portrait of the post-war American South. Here is the young Muir talking with freed slaves and former Confederate soldiers, pondering the uses of electricity, exploring Mammoth Cave, sleeping in a Savannah cemetery, delirious with malarial fever in the home of strangers at Cedar Key, traveling to Havana, Cuba, anJohn Muir (1838-1914), founder of the Sierra Club and a prime mover in the birth of the National Park movement, is the author of such classics as Our National Parks, My First Summer in the Sierra, and Travels in Alaska.

With a superb cast (including Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall) directed by Sidney Lumet, the film won four Academy Awards and indelibly shaped how we think about corporate and media power.</p><p><br>In <i>Mad As Hell</i>, Dave Itzkoff of <i>The New York Times</i> recounts the surprising and dramatic story of how<i>Network</i> made it to the screen. Such a movie rarely gets made any more--one man's vision of the world, independent of studio testing or market research. And that man was Paddy Chayefsky, the tough, driven, Oscar-winning screenwriter whose vision--outlandish for its time--is all too real today. Itzkoff uses interviews with the cast and crew, as well as Chayefsky's notes, letters, and drafts to re-create the action in front of and behind the camera at a time of swirling cultural turmoil. The result is a riveting account that enriches our appreciation of this prophetic and still-startling film.<br><br>Itzkoff also speaks with today's leading broadcasters and filmmakers to assess <i>Network</i>'s lasting impact on television and popular culture. They testify to the enduring genius of Paddy Chayefsky, who foresaw the future and whose life offers an unforgettable lesson about the true cost of self-expression.</p></p><p><b>Dave Itzkoff</b> is the author of <i>M</i><i>ad as Hell, Cocaine&#x2019;s Son</i>, and <i>Lads</i>. He is a culture reporter at <i>The New York Times</i>, where he writes regularly about film, television, theater, music, and popular culture. He previously worked at <i>Spin, Maxim, </i>and <i>Details</i>, and his work has appeared in <i>GQ</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Wired</i>, and other publications. He lives in New York City.Prologue <p></p>He was at his best when he was angry. It wasn&#x2019;t simply that so many things bothered him, or that when they did, they irritated him to the fullest possible degree. But where others avoided conflict, he cultivated it and embraced it. His fury nourished him, making him intense and unpredictable, but also keeping him focused and productive. He was not generally the sort of person who felt the need to clench his fists in violence or submerge his sorrows in drink. But he knew what it was like to have desires and see them denied; he knew how it felt to cry out and not be heard. His outrage simmered in his spleen and surged through his veins, collecting in his fingertips until it pushed his pen across paper and punched the keys of his typewriter. He wrestled his rancor into words and sentences and speeches. When Paddy Chayefsky&#x2019;s characters spoke, they spoke with his aggravated, articulate voice, and yet they seemed to speak for everyone. <p></p>While his career was in ascendance, he was hailed as the dramatist of the common man, whose ear for the language of the underclass was so uncanny that it was said he must have transcribed it from a tape recorder. His best-known characters were thwarted people who feared nothing so much as unfulfillment, whose most emphatic and memorable dialogue poured out of them in aggressive bursts, arriving in explosive climaxes after scene upon scene of unvoiced frustration and unresolved conflict. Whether he was imagining the inner life of a lowly, lovelorn butcher or the impotent chief of medicine at a major metropolitan hospital, Chayefsky could relate to these men. Their struggle for even a minimal amount of autonomy mirrored their creator&#x2019;s refusal to cede any amount of control in his life and especially in his work. <p></p>He had all the accumulated resentments of a man of his time and place, who had lived through the Great Depression and fought in World War II, and who strived to fulfill the dreams of his immigrant parents and outpace anyone he regarded as a rival or a colleague. He was a short, stocky Bronx-born Jew, a son of the Grand Concourse with narrow eyes framed by large, owlish glasses, and a head of unkempt brown and white hair, with an impish goatee to match. He had no regard for fashion or convention and possessed a mischievous, cantankerous personality. A sincere compliment directed his way could trigger his venomous invective as easily as a well-deployed insult or dirty joke could earn his respect. <p></p>Chayefsky was the rare writer whose reputation earned him absolute authority on his projects&#x2014;supremacy above even the directors and producers he worked with&#x2014;and he sought only projects where he was allowed this authority. But what defined his writing now, in 1974, was that none of it was working. Back in the 1950s it had taken only a few years of toiling in that newly created format of television for him to cast it aside in favor of a more respectable and lucrative career in motion pictures; and only a few more years of disappointment there to leave film for the theater, where he was certain he would retain total control over the material he created; and only a few more years of total discouragement in that field to abandon the stage and return to the movies. <p></p>At the age of fifty-one, he could get his film scripts commissioned but not produced; he could get his television pilots shot but couldn&#x2019;t get them on the air; and it would require the collective disappearance of every other form of dramatic art before he ever wrote another play for Broadway. The Academy Award he had won for his screenwriting two years earlier seemed less like an affirmation of his talents than a solemn, faceless bookend to the Oscar he had received back in 1956: one statue to signify where the journey of a once-promising screenwriter started and the other to mark its termination. <p></p>It was not only the repeatedly obstructed ambition to have his work seen by audiences again that was bothering Chayefsky, although that was a concern. The mission that consumed him with unusual urgency was to say something universal and definitive, to make the lasting statement that the compass of his career had always pointed to and that would make him worthy of the attention he had commanded at his peak. Every rung he climbed on his way up had given Chayefsky a higher perch to see the world more clearly, and all he saw were problems he could not solve. At his Central Park West apartment awaited a wife who almost never ventured outside, as she suffered from a mysterious malady neither he nor any doctor could help with, and a self-destructive teenage son he could not understand. He feared constantly for his livelihood and was struggling with tax problems, while he watched with resigned astonishment as the city he called home and the country he loved appeared to be unraveling. Revolutions were springing up everywhere&#x2014;politically, socially, artistically, cinematically&#x2014;and he wanted no part of them. <p></p>Then there was television, a blossoming medium he had helped to&nbsp;define and popularize, with the potential for connecting every person on the planet in an instant. But in two quick decades it had become hopelessly, irrevocably corrupt, devaluing truth and alienating viewers from one another. <p></p>With so many threats stirring, it seemed irresponsible to Chayefsky for him to ignore them in his writing. Was he the only one who felt a growing risk of terrorist attacks by suicidal militants? Who saw a rising tide of anti-Semitism and hostility against Israel? Who felt the creeping influence of foreign powers&#x2014;Arab powers&#x2014;in the American economy? Yet the more frantically he sought to clarify the message he believed was being transmitted to him from a hundred different sources, the more certain he felt it was eluding him. <p></p>Take, for example, the screenplay that he had started researching a&nbsp;few months earlier. Having cast his gaze on the television business that had provided the springboard for his career, he had drawn up a roster of characters to populate the world of a fictional broadcasting company: producers, executives, underlings, corporate tycoons, political radicals, and a mentally unstable news anchor named Howard Beale. But Chayefsky could not determine how they fit together. Were they allegorical figures in a larger narrative about power and decadence, or were they just a bunch of grotesque caricatures? What did any of them have to do with the love story he was trying to thread through his script, and was that too conventional even to belong there? <p></p>Across the top of a piece of paper he had torn from a notebook, Chayefsky wrote in jagged capital letters nearly impaled by an aggressive underline: the show lacks a point of view. Then, in a gentler, pleading cursive handwriting, he filled both sides of that page with his unflinching self-analysis of the project, which he believed was drifting into chaos. <p></p>"I guess what bothers me is that the picture seems to have no ultimate statement beyond the idea that a network would kill for ratings," he wrote. <p></p>Most crucially, he wondered, what was he even trying to say in this screenplay? Were there identifiable sides to this argument, and whose side was he on? Because if he couldn&#x2019;t answer that, what was he creating, if not more fuel for his pyre of curtailed efforts and unsatisfied aspirations? <p></p>"We are making some kind of statement about American society," he wrote, "and its lack of clarity is what&#x2019;s bothering me&#x2014;Even more, I&#x2019;m not taking a stand&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not for anything or anyone&#x2014;If we give Howard a speech at the end of the show, what would he say?" <p></p>Sometime later, on a piece of the blank yellow paper he more commonly used for his writing, Chayefsky started to answer this question by sketching out a few handwritten phrases: "I want you people to get mad&#x2014;You don&#x2019;t have to organize or vote for reformers&#x2014;You just have to get mad." <p></p>Within months, Chayefsky would harness his boundless capacity for anger and channel it into his script for a motion picture called <i>Network</i>, investing it with all the angst, anxiety, and paranoia he had ever felt. The resulting film, released in 1976, would become a potent document, instantly incendiary and wildly popular. <p></p> <i>Network</i> was a bundle of contradictions, the last gasp of an era of populist Hollywood filmmaking as expressed by a man who never subscribed to the movement; it used the resources of one mass medium to indict another and, beyond it, the degradation and emptiness of contemporary American life. <i>Network</i> scandalized the television news business, inflaming the influential denizens who took more offense at the cartoonish portrayal of their world than its author intended or expected. But by arriving at a moment of maximal national frustration, the movie made itself the center of an argument about society and personal identity and inserted itself into the cultural lexicon, earning money, winning awards, and lifting its creator to new heights of acclaim. <p></p>The eerie and uncanny prescience of <i>Network</i>&#x2014;dismissed in its day even by some of its admirers as an impossibly absurd satire&#x2014;was not limited to the moment in which it made its portentous debut. Not&nbsp;only did it seem to foretell the tragic death of one of its lead performers; it provided a road map for the unraveling of the monolithic broadcasting companies, the diminishment of their once-mighty news operations, and the path to a fragmented and unrecognizable media environment that the industry would follow, almost to the letter, over the next forty years. <p></p>The film also carried a personal warning to Chayefsky, who spent most of his professional life fearing that the messages in his writing were not being received by their audiences. <i>Network</i> was indeed his magnum opus, and the last movie that he would willingly put his name on. It would cost him nearly everything to make it exactly as he wanted it to be, and when it was done it would leave him with a stark lesson about the ultimate price of self-expression. <p></p>Copyright ï¿½ 2014 by Dave Itzkoff</p><h2>Sinister and Fatal: The Guinevere Jones Collection Volume 2</h2><p><b><i>The enthralling Guinevere Jones series continues with </i>The Sinister Touch<i> and </i>The Fatal Fortune<i>, together for the first time!</i></b><br><br><b>Fortune doesn&#x2019;t shine on Guinevere Jones and Zac Justis in the mesmerizing continuation of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.</b><br><br><i>The Sinister Touch</i><br><br>Guinevere Jones has her head turned by the handsome young artist across the way.

Andras Lï¿½vi, a Hungarian-Jewish architecture student, arrives from Budapest with a scholarship, a single suitcase, and a mysterious letter he has promised to deliver to C. Morgenstern on the rue de Sï¿½vignï¿½. As he falls into a complicated relationship with the letter&#x2019;s recipient, he becomes privy to a secret history that will alter the course of his own life. Meanwhile, as his elder brother takes up medical studies in Modena and their younger brother leaves school for the stage, Europe&#x2019;s unfolding tragedy sends each of their lives into terrifying uncertainty. At the end of Andras&#x2019;s second summer in Paris, all of Europe erupts in a cataclysm of war.<br><br>From the small Hungarian town of Konyï¿½r to the grand opera houses of Budapest and Paris, from the lonely chill of Andras&#x2019;s room on the rue des ï¿½coles to the deep and enduring connection he discovers on the rue de Sï¿½vignï¿½, from the despair of Carpathian winter to an unimaginable life in forced labor camps and beyond, <i>The Invisible Bridge</i> tells the story of a love tested by disaster, of brothers whose bonds cannot be broken, of a family shattered and remade in history&#x2019;s darkest hour, and of the dangerous power of art in a time of war.<br><br>Expertly crafted, magnificently written, emotionally haunting, and impossible to put down, <i>The Invisible </i>Bridge resoundingly confirms Julie Orringer&#x2019;s place as one of today&#x2019;s most vital and commanding young literary talents.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong>: Even if this weren't her first novel, Julie Orringer's Invisible Bridge would be a marvelous achievement. Orringer possesses a rare talent that makes a 600-page story--which, we know, must descend into war and genocide--feel rivetingly readable, even at its grimmest. Building vivid worlds in effortless phrases, she immerses us in 1930s Budapest just as a young Hungarian Jew, Andras Lï¿½vi, departs for the ï¿½cole Spï¿½ciale d'Architecture in Paris. He hones his talent for design, works backstage in a theater, and allies with other Jewish students in defiance of rising Nazi influence. And then he meets Klara, a captivating Hungarian ballet instructor nine years his senior with a painful past and a willful teenage daughter. Against Klara's better judgment, love engulfs them, drowning out the rumblings of war for a time. But inevitably, Nazi aggression drives them back to Hungary, where life for the Jews goes from hardship to horror. As in <em>Dr. Zhivago</em>, these lovers can't escape history's merciless machinery, but love gives them the courage to endure. --<i>Mari Malcolm</i><p></p>Julie Orringer is the author of the award-winning short-story collection <i>How to Breathe Underwater, </i>which was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book<i>.</i> She is the winner of <i>The Paris Review</i>&#x2019;s Discovery Prize and the recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, Stanford University, and the Dorothy and Lewis B.

Deep in the desert, a young heretic narrowly escapes certain death and leaves for a mission of glory and madness. He is El Murid, also called the Disciple. He promises to bring prosperity, righteousness, and order to the desert people of Hammad al Nakir. They have waited for El Murid for 400 years. They have wanted a savior who can build a new empire by defeating their enemies. But El Murid is not everything he appears to be, and the dark and evil forces pulling the strings of empire come into the forefront. Who and what lie behind El Murid&#x2019;s vision of a desert empire?&nbsp;<br><br>The Dread Empire is a gritty world filled with larger-than-life plots, maddening magic, bizarre creatures, nation-shattering conflict, and painfully honest and flawed heroes.

With supplies and housing stretched to the breaking point, it is clear that the refugees must be relocated down to the planet, and soon. But not to the <i>atevi</i> mainland: rather to the territory reserved for human, the island of Mospheira. <br><br> Tabini-aiji, the powerful political head of the <i>atevi</i>, tasks his brilliant human diplomat, Bren Cameron, to negotiate with the Mospheiran government. For the Alpha Station refugees represent a political faction that the people of Mospheira broke from two centuries ago, and these Mospheirans are not enthusiastic about welcoming these immigrants from space. <br><br> In the decades Bren has served Tabini, he has become enmeshed in the <i>atevi</i> world in a way no human ever has before. Bren is now an <i>atevi</i> lord, with his own estate on the mainland, his own household, and his own Assassin&#x2019;s Guild bodyguards. He is a treasured resource to Tabini and has become close to Tabini&#x2019;s young son and heir, Cajieri, the first <i>atevi</i> child ever to grow up in the presence of a human. <br><br> Tabini, impatient with human politics, has ordered Bren to return to the island of his birth in his official capacity as an <i>atevi</i> lord, with his full <i>atevi</i> retinue. Bren is to inform the president of Mospheira that he is no longer his diplomat, that Mospheira must take in the refugees from Alpha, and that there is no other acceptable solution. And among the refugees are three children requiring special protection because Cajieri has made them his &#x201c;associates&#x201d;&#x2014;a bond of <i>atevi </i>loyalty that is unbreakable and lifelong.<br><br> While Bren travels to Mospheira, Tabini sends Cajieri to the country to visit his uncle Tatiseigi&#x2014;a political gesture to shore up an old man and give the boy a well-earned vacation, a cherished opportunity to escape the formality of the <i>atevi</i> court. Tatiseigi&#x2019;s neighbors, however, are determined to end an old feud to their own satisfaction....and Cajieri&#x2019;s presence is just the excuse they need.</p><p><b>C. J.

But not, immediately, to the Bujavid&#x2019;s third-floor residency. Tabini-aiji had sent a request to the Buï¿½javid&#x2019;s train station, hand-delivered by Assassins&#x2019; Guild, to meet with him in his downstairs office...uncommon venue, but likewise safe from eavesdropping, even from servant staff. <br> &nbsp;<br> And from immediate family. Which, in the situation they had in the world, might be a needful consideration. <br> &nbsp;<br> Such considerations applied, even in the narrow confines of the lift car that rose from the underground train station. Bren Cameron, paidhi-aiji, translator, diplomat&#x2014;and carrying, in a document case, the outcome of an encounter that still had the world anxious and unsettled&#x2014;also carried a secret. His four atevi bodyguards, Guild themselves&#x2014;black-skinned and golden- eyed, head and shoulders taller than most humans&#x2014;all knew it. The aiji-dowager, Ilisidi, diminutive for an ateva, armed with a cane that lent stability to aged bones in the long, rapid rise&#x2014;she knew the gist of it. So did her two bodyguards. The third of their company, Cajeiri, aged fortunate nine years, Tabini-aiji&#x2019;s son, did not. His bodyguard, Guild, but still in their teens, did not, and Bren had been extremely careful to keep it that way. <br> &nbsp;<br> Three hours back on Earth and they were all still suffering, to varying degrees, the effects of the express shuttle flight from the station. <br> &nbsp;<br> The lift stopped, opened doors on the ornate lower floor with its travertine columns, its plinths with ornate porcelains and its tapestries and hand-loomed carpet runners. This corridor, this area, was at a T intersection with the main entry hall, the public areas, the audience chamber, the public museum and state library, the office of records&#x2014;places where the public went. <br> &nbsp;<br> This hallway&#x2014;no. A black velvet rope on four gilt stanchions provided a gentle security. Two black-clad members of the Guild stood there, armed, a less gentle reminder that, no, these were not public lifts, and the upper and lower floors were not on the tour. <br> &nbsp;<br> Bren and company crossed the hall. The guards at the office doors, Tabini&#x2019;s own&#x2014;on loan from his grandmother the aiji-dowager herself, in point of fact&#x2014;opened the doors without a word exchanged. <br> &nbsp;<br> The three of them entered. All the bodyguards but the dowï¿½ager&#x2019;s two, Cenedi and Nawari, remained outside; and Bren walked hindmost&#x2014;mere court official here, if not in the heavï¿½ens. Tabini sat at his desk, isolate in a very large office, a place of towering windows, immense tapestries, carpet far more anï¿½cient than that bearing traffic outside. <br> &nbsp;<br> There were chairs, felicitous three. Cenedi arranged the endï¿½most for Ilisidi, would have taken her cane, but she retained possession of it, and Cenedi and Nawari withdrew from the room entirely. <br> Tabini turned his chair to face them as Cajeiri settled into the chair beside his great-grandmother, and Bren sat down...feeling a little plainly dressed for the executive office, for the aiji of the majority of the world&#x2014;very little cuff and collar lace, which tended to float in lack of gravity, plain coat and trousers, a ribbon that might be a little askew: Bren&#x2019;s bodyguard had re-tied it on the train. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Grandmother,&#x201d; Tabini said. &#x201c;Son of mine. Paidhi.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> That was the greeting, for three who&#x2019;d just come from the heavens, with a document guaranteeing the world&#x2019;s survival, at least as regarded the kyo presence up there. It was not want of concern. Concern was evident if one read atevi, and Bren did. Half-rising, he laid the all-important document case on Tabini&#x2019;s desk. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One worried,&#x201d; Tabini said then, &#x201c;regarding the weather.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Ilisidi waved her hand, dismissive. &#x201c;It would not dare storm. We were assured we would land well ahead of the front. As we did. The pilots were quite confident, or we might have stayed circling the world indefinitely, we were assured. Read the docï¿½ument, grandson. It took considerable effort to obtain it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not only among the kyo, as one hears,&#x201d; Tabini said, making no such move. &#x201c;One trusts they are departing.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Far more rapidly than they arrived, aiji-ma,&#x201d; Bren said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Without further communication.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Without a word,&#x201d; Bren said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And Gin-nandi is now in charge,&#x201d; Tabini said, &#x201c;of both Mospheiran <i>and </i>Reunioner folk up there.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, honored Father,&#x201d; Cajeiri said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gin-nandi will request atevi assistance to land the Reï¿½unioners.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, aiji-ma,&#x201d; Bren said. &#x201c;They have not fared well on the station. There are security issues.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One understands that the Presidenta of Mospheira considï¿½ers them all his people. But that we will receive a request to transport numbers of Reunioners on atevi shuttles. Have we seals on that?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We shall have,&#x201d; Bren said. &#x201c;Likewise we shall have requests for landing zones for parachuted capsules.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not bearing Reunioners.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, aiji-ma. Only cargo displaced from the shuttles. This was Gin-nandi&#x2019;s idea, and it will move that population to safety without a shuttle-building campaign.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Presidenta is not about to suggest that we subsidize settlement for these people.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He will hope only for your cooperation in the program. They are a human problem.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You have the children and their parents lodged with Lord Geigi. It is your intention to land them on the next shuttle flight...an earnest of things to come.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A pleasant, an innocent face on the undertaking, aiji-ma&#x2014; representative of most of these people. They have suffered very heavy losses&#x2014;in the kyo assault on Reunion, few households were left intact. The kyo themselves regret the attack. They have expressed that. They misinterpreted the presence of the colony. They have expressed sorrow at the situation, and they have absolutely no inclination to do harm to atevi or to Mospheirans or the Reunioners. This document is a resolution of disengagement, with the provision that, should we wish to conï¿½tact them peacefully, there is an appointed place and procedure.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Tabini nodded. &#x201c;At Reunion. Which they will retain.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They are doubtless sifting it for every morsel of information they can gain from it,&#x201d; Ilisidi remarked dryly, &#x201c;and since we have accorded humans an island to live on and half a station orbiting over our heads, we have <i>some </i>interest in their interest, but <i>we </i>have observed the kyo representatives, and we find them reasonable folk.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One was Prakuyo&#x2019;s son,&#x201d; Cajeiri said. &#x201c;And we talked, honï¿½ored Father. We spent a lot of time talking. I, myself. And their security played chess with mani.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One can only imagine,&#x201d; Tabini said, equally dryly, while the document case lay untouched on his desk. &#x201c;Chess, was it?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A very interesting opponent,&#x201d; Ilisidi said. &#x201c;I shall play you a round, grandson, using <i>his </i>style.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> One had absolutely no doubt that that would be an interestï¿½ing game...and no game, but a distillation of observations that didn&#x2019;t fit neatly in the vocabulary they&#x2019;d collected. Bren had his own set of notes he&#x2019;d taken since, and on the way down&#x2014;to preserve the immediacy of the information. Likely no one else could read those, either: circles, diagrams, arrows, and lines of relationship and relevance: non-words that had no equivalent in the languages he dealt with, words that might combine concepts humans and atevi didn&#x2019;t see as related, and that he had to commit to more readable notes. It was an archiï¿½tecture atevi might have to deal with&#x2014;someday. Not soon, however. The document in that case saw to that. <br> &nbsp;<br> And left him questioning his own sense of right and wrong. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I shall look forward to it,&#x201d; Tabini said, &#x201c;once we have reï¿½solved the lingering problems, such as onto <i>whose </i>land Lord Geigi proposes to drop the equivalent of rail cars from the heavï¿½ens, and <i>how </i>we shall secure the safety of these children Lord Geigi has as guests.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We might bring them and their parents down on <i>our </i>shutï¿½tle,&#x201d; Cajeiri said, &#x201c;and they might be at Najida, honored Father, at least until there is a place for them.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Tabini said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Honored Father&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They are human. They are Reunioner. Someday, as we susï¿½pect, they will be of service to you, as nand&#x2019; Bren is to us. When you came back to us, <i>you </i>benefitted from atevi associations. You began to feel man&#x2019;chi, you had the chance to form associaï¿½tions in a normal way...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They have man&#x2019;chi to <i>me, </i>honored Father.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nand&#x2019; Bren may argue that they do not. They may have a profound sentiment, but a <i>human </i>sentiment, son of mine, which, since they are not adult, is still forming. They have lived in fear much of their lives, have been uprooted from their home, transported across space in less than comfortable cirï¿½cumstances, subjected to Tillington&#x2019;s ill-run administration, entertained in great luxury on Earth and finally dropped into Lord Geigi&#x2019;s household in the heavens&#x2014;but they have never seen humans live as humans live on Mospheira. Now they will see all their people brought down to the world to become Mospheirans&#x2014;yet one more experience in their young lives. You may ask nand&#x2019; Bren what his opinion is. But consider that you have the satisfaction of man&#x2019;chi in this household. What connection does their birth fit them to feel? And should they not be given the chance to discover it, and should not their parï¿½ents have that chance?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Cajeiri was silent a moment&#x2014;not an angry silence; not an entirely happy one. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They should,&#x201d; Cajeiri said then. &#x201c;One understands. One did not feel, then&#x2014;all that one feels now. One hopes&#x2014;one hopes the same for them.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A human had no precise idea what Cajeiri was feeling at that moment. A human could imagine&#x2014;but dared not inject too much that was human into it. Or too little. Pain was involved, pain of separation. Massively frustrated instincts figured in it. <br> &nbsp;<br> So did human attachments on the other side&#x2014;matter. The children needed the ability to judge human folk accurately, the ability to judge people&#x2014;and trust people&#x2014;and <i>distrust </i>with acï¿½curacy. The ability to form those concepts like self-worth and selfless love...feelings that could go hurtfully sideways in the interface between human and atevi. He himself had had his human sensitivities well-developed, if a bit over-developed in some cases&#x2014;before he took on the paidhi&#x2019;s job, and learned that when atevi committed, they committed profoundly, potentially for life and death. <br> &nbsp;<br> He <i>had </i>that devotion, in those four outside this room: in Banichi and Jago, Tano and Algini&#x2014;a connection so close as to <i>be </i>self, an upward flow of loyalty that didn&#x2019;t ask questions in a crisis and didn&#x2019;t want reciprocity from him, no, not in the least. An aiji&#x2019;s role was to <i>be </i>protected, so he could use his skill to keep them all <i>out </i>of crisis in the first place, or to pick up the pieces when things went wrong. That was how atevi felt cenï¿½tered and heart-sure. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>No, </i>Cajeiri didn&#x2019;t want to <i>be </i>one of those kids. He wanted to steer their lives for them, in a good way. In the best and most devoted and atevi way, being what he was, which was literally born to lead. While they took care of him. And right now doing that meant giving them up, which was, for Cajeiri, as painful as unrequited love for a human. It was a lot to ask of a nine-year-old whose privilege was absolute, and who, in his highly securitied world, had absolutely <i>no one </i>who wasn&#x2019;t adult and taking care of <i>him. </i>His teenaged aishid, his bodyguard, was only a few years older than he was. That relationship would deepen over time. One sincerely hoped it would. There was nothing wrong with that foursome, nothing lacking but the profound experiï¿½ence that had welded young Cajeiri to four human kids in a voyage before that atevi foursome had ever had a chance to afï¿½fect him. <br> &nbsp;<br> Damn, Bren thought. Just&#x2014;damn. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Our son,&#x201d; Tabini said, nodding slightly, &#x201c;our <i>heir, </i>satisfies all expectations. Go upstairs and please your mother.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Dismissed. Atop it all. <br> &nbsp;<br> But the young gentleman knew there were secrets. He waded hip-deep in secrets, only some of which he was privy to. A year ago he might have protested his not knowing what had gone on, when messages had come from the kyo ship and his great- grandmother&#x2019;s door had shut, sealing one kyo and Cenedi, her chief bodyguard, into conference&#x2014;and not him, and not the young kyo who had sat with him, equally excluded. <br> &nbsp;<br> Secrets. Damned right there were secrets. Even the dowager didn&#x2019;t know all of them. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One is gratified, honored Father.&#x201d; Cajeiri quietly rose, bowed&#x2014;Bren likewise rose, Cajeiri&#x2019;s rank demanding it. His acï¿½tions just now demanded it. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cajeiri left, quietly. <br> &nbsp;<br> Tabini took up the document case and opened it, extracting a piece of paper or its analog never made on Earth, and bedecked with seals and stamps of some substance not wax, written in various colors not ordinary in atevi documents. Three lanï¿½guages, three forms of writing, one of which evoked sounds neither human nor atevi could duplicate...<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You have read this,&#x201d; Tabini said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only the paidhi can read all three,&#x201d; Ilisidi said with a wave of her hand. &#x201c;He believes they are identical enough.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;One can decipher key words,&#x201d; Bren said, &#x201c;to indicate that the substance is the same. <i>Read </i>it, no. One was obliged to take their word for it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Under the circumstances,&#x201d; Tabini said, perusing the docuï¿½ment, &#x201c;understandable.&#x201d; He scanned it for a moment. &#x201c;Your hand, your seal, is set to all sections but one.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> For the Ragi version, and the Mosphei&#x2019;, it was his signature and his imprint. The kyo version, Prakuyo an Tep had written, by hand, and signed all three documents. As he had signed, for the President of Mospheira, and the aiji of the aishidi&#x2019;tat, and the four <i>Phoenix </i>captains, all of whom he had represented. One document was headed out of the solar system at the moment. One was on Tabini&#x2019;s desk. One remained to deliver to the Presï¿½ident of Mospheira, to whom the kyo imputed all human auï¿½thority, on Earth, on the station, and over the ship that served it&#x2014;a point it had not, at the time, seemed safe to contradict. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It seems a very simple document,&#x201d; Tabini said. &#x201c;I know you, paidhi. Did you gain all you wished?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I gained all I wished.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In these simple words.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Complexity and subclauses seemed only likely to compliï¿½cate matters. In essence, the kyo will not advance beyond Reï¿½union in our direction&#x2014; ne has to understand that, while everything in space may be reckoned as a sphere, and boundarï¿½ies are difficult to define, there are paths in the heavens, routes dictated by the avoidance of hazards and the availability of reï¿½sources.

This is a practical guide to the art of blessing.</p><p>Rolf Garborg began his thirty-five year ministry in the Christian Publishing industry as a twenty-two year-old missionary in Puerto Rico selling books door to door. That meager beginning evolved into the establishment of a successful Christian bookstore and distribution center on the island, as well as the founding of Editorial Betania, a Spanish publishing house that continues today. <p> Upon returning to the United States in 1975, Rolf continued in leadership for a variety of publishing organizations before co-founding Garborg's, a Christian gift company. Since Garborg's was sold in 2001, he has begun Garborg &amp; Asscoiates, a consulting company serving the Christian publishing and gift industries. Rolf's career has taken him to all fifty states and over eighty countries, providing him the opportunity to bless and be blessed the world over. </p><p> Rolf has been married for more than thirty years to Mary Garborg. They are blessed with two children and three grandchildren. Rolf and Mary currently reside in Minnesota.</p>Every night, as we tuck our six children into bed, we are asked, &#39;Can I have my blessing now?&#39; As our babies grow up into young adults, they are continually reminded by their family blessing that they are loved by God, delighted in by their parents, and have a rich future awaiting them as followers of Christ. The tradition of a &#39;Family Blessing&#39; as Rolf shares in this book, has become a priceless and vital part of our daily lives. --Kirk and Chelsea Cameron - Co-stars of the nationally syndicated hit, Growing Pains</p><h2>I&#39;m Fascinated by Sacrifice Flies: Inside the Game We All Love</h2><p><p>The <i>New York Times </i>Bestseller!</p><p>In the aftermath of the Steroid Era that stained the game of baseball, at a time when so many players are so rich and therefore have a sense of entitlement that they haven't earned, ESPN baseball commentator Tim Kurkjian shows readers how to love the game more than ever, with incredible insight and stories that are hilarious, heartbreaking, and revealing.</p><p>From what Pete Rose was doing in the batting cage a few minutes after getting out of prison, to why everyone strikes out these days and why no one seems to care, <i>I'm Fascinated By Sacrifice Flies</i> will surprise even longtime baseball fans.

What is luck? A psychic gift or a question of intelligence? And what is it that lucky people have that unlucky people lack? Psychologist Dr. Richard Wiseman put luck under a scientific microscope for the very first time, examining the different ways in which lucky and unlucky people think and behave. After three years of intensive interviews and experiments with over 400 volunteers, Wiseman arrived at an astonishing conclusion: Luck is something that can be learned. It is available to anyone willing to pay attention to the Four Essential Principles: </p><p>. Creating Chance Opportunities <br>. Thinking Lucky <br>. Feeling Lucky <br>. Denying Fate </p><p>Readers can determine their capacity for luck as well as learn to change their luck through helpful exercises that appear throughout the book. Illustrated with anecdotes from the lives of the famous such as Harry Truman and Warren Buffett, The Luck Factor also richly portrays the lives of ordinary people who have been extraordinarily lucky or unlucky. Finally Dr. Wiseman gives us a look into "The Luck School" where he instructs unlucky people and also teaches lucky people how to further enhance their luck. </p><p>Smart, enlightening, fun to read, and easy to follow, The Luck Factor will give you revolutionary insight into the lucky mind and could, quite simply, change your life. </p></p><p>A revolutionary study of luck and its power to transform our lives. <br> <br>Have you ever wondered why some people seem to have all the luck, and others seem to be born unlucky? Any why do some people get to lead fulfilling lives, while others face endless failure and sadness? Is it just a matter of fate, or can unlucky people improve their luck and their lives? <br> <br>Ten years ago, Dr. Richard Wiseman decided to search for the elusive luck factor by charting the actual beliefs and experiences of lucky and unlucky people. From the results, he identified four main factors that explained luck. He was then able to show a group of people, who considered themselves unlucky, how to think and behave like lucky people. The results were astounding, with almost all participants reporting significant life changes -- including increased levels of self-esteem, physical well-being, confidence and success. <br> <br>The principles Dr. Wiseman reveals in this ground-breaking study can teach you how to change your luck, and literally change your life.Dr. Richard Wiseman heads a research unit within the psychology department at the University of Herfordshire in Britain and was recently given the prestigious CSICOP Public Education in Science Award.

Elaborately researched and fluidly written, <i>Reclaiming Our Health</i> is a provocative and crystal-clear commentary on one of the most complex issues facing America todaynational health care. In an epic look at the human and financial consequences of the polarization of traditional and alternative medicine, John Robbins calls for nothing short of a revolution in the basic beliefs on which traditional health care is provided. <p>Robbins has written a masterpiece that will be as popular with people unhappy with the medical establishment as <i>Diet for a New America</i> is with critics of the meat industry. Although we spend $1 trillion each year on health care, the toll in human suffering from degenerative disease continues to rise and many in our country cannot afford basic health care. Meanwhile, women are growing increasingly frustrated with the care they receive from a male-dominated system; and the incidence of dangerous communicable diseases is growing. </p><p>There are answers to these problems and the myriad others that we face, but the dogmatic and monopolistic beliefs held by modern medicine are preventing us from finding the. <i>Reclaiming Our Health</i> presents a brilliant, refreshing, and uplifting new vision of what health care might be.</p></p><p>To our readers: The books we publish are our contribution to an emerging world based on cooperation rather than on competition, on affirmation of the human spirit rather than on self-doubt, and on the certainty that all humanity is connected. Our goal is to touch as many lives as possible with a message of hope for a better world. - Hal and Linda Kramer, PublishersA Prescription for Real Health Care Reform In his rousing and inspirational style, John Robbins, author of the acclaimed best-seller, <i>Diet for a New America</i>, turns his attention to the national debate on health care. Calling for nothing short of a revolution in the basic beliefs on which health care is based, he convincingly demonstrates the enormous human and financial costs of the polarization of conventional and alternative medicine. <p>Although Americans spend far more money on health care than any other people in the world, many of us cannot afford the most basic coverage. We rank 25th amount the worlds nations in infant mortality; the toll in human suffering from degenerative disease continues to rise; the danger from virulent communicable diseases is increasing daily; and, meanwhile, women are growing increasingly frustrated with the care they receive from a male-dominated system. </p><p>With a foreword by Marianne Williamson and an introduction by Riane Eisler, <i>Reclaiming Our Health</i> offers a brilliant, refreshing and uplifting new vision of what health care in America might be, as well as practical solutions for us as individual and for a health-care system gone awry.</p></p><h2>The Best of Steely Dan</h2><p>(Transcribed Score).

Bach, Pablo Casals, and the Search for A Baroque Masterpiece</h2><p>One evening, not long after ending a stint as the pop music critic at the Montreal Gazette, Eric Siblin attended a recital of Johann Sebastian Bach&#39;s &#34;Cello Suites.&#34; There, something unlikely happened: he fell deeply in love with the music. So began an epic quest that would unravel three centuries of intrigue, politics, and passion. Part biography, part music history, and part mystery, The Cello Suites weaves together three dramatic narratives: Bach&#39;s composition of the suites and the manuscript&#39;s subsequent disappearance in the eighteenth century; Pablo Casals&#39;s historic discovery of the music in Spain in the late nineteenth century, and his popularization of the suites several decades later; and Siblin&#39;s own infatuation with the suites at the dawn of the twenty-first century. His search to learn all he can about the music leads Siblin to Barcelona, where Pablo Casals, just thirteen and in possession of his first cello, roamed the back streets with his father, in search of sheet music</p><p>Eric Siblin is a Montreal-based journalist and documentary filmmaker. He worked as a reporter/editor at the Montreal bureau of The Canadian Press (CP) from 1989 to 1996 when he joined The Montreal Gazette as a staff reporter, including a stint as the newspaper's pop music critic. He made the transition to television in 2002 with the documentary Word Slingers, which explores the curious subculture of competitive Scrabble tournaments. The film was broadcast in Canada and the U.S., and won a Jury Award at the Yorkton Short Film &amp; Video Festival. He also co-directed the documentary <i>In Search of Sleep</i>, and has written for a wide variety of magazines. <i>The Cello Suites</i> is his first book.<br> <i>The Cello Suites</i> is a work of ever-percolating interest.

Emulating all character dialog, including the women's, Ericson uses his versatile, clear, well-modulated voice effectively. He manages believable, if not authentic, Scottish accents and generally is able to help the listener distinguish among the many characters. In one of the multiple story lines, Jeff Holt leaves his fur-trapping business to return east and find his wife, Melissa. Melissa's father tries to keep Jeff from finding her while Melissa contends with an unwanted suitor. Meanwhile, Jeff's brother Clay and Clay's Sioux wife lead a difficult, dangerous expedition up the Yellowstone River. While offering a realistic view of the dynamic, perilous Old West era, the action and story development are often slow. Additionally, while the production quality is excellent, some of the dialog is stilted and dull.

After the Second World War Eugen Herrigel introduced the concept of kyudo to the West in his classic Zen in the Art of Japanese Archery. But until now, no Japanese kyudo master has published a book on his art in English. <br><br>In <em>Kyudo: The Essence and Practice of Japanese Archery</em>, Hideharu Onuma and his American co-authors, Dan and Jackie DeProspero, explain in detail both the spiritual and practical aspects of kyudo. Written with both novices and advanced students in mind, the book is presented in simple, straightforward language and features hundreds of detailed illustrations, supplemented by rare photographs of Master Onuma, clearly demonstrating the fundamental techniques and daily practice of this form of "standing Zen." <br><br>Including chapters on equipment and kyudojo construction, <em>Kyudo: The Essence and Practice of Japanese Archery</em> is the most comprehensive reference work on the subject available. Special sections on problem solving and <em>shitsu</em> (errors) also make it a unique teaching and learning resource, and the concluding <em>shiteimondo</em> (teacher-student dialogue) provides unparalleled insights into the thoughts and teachings of a true master of the martial arts.</p><p><br>HIDEHARU ONUMA was the 15th-generation headmaster of the Heki Ryu Sekka-ha school of archery and kyudo banshi, 9th dan. He was born in Tokyo in 1910 into a highly respected archery family. Onuma sensei, who was instrumental in introducing kyudo to the West, believed that kyudo belonged not just to the Japanese but to the whole world. Until his death in 1990 he made regular trips abroad to demonstrate and teach his art. <br><br>DAN and JACKIE DEPROSPERO left the United States for Japan in 1981, intending to stay for one year. Shortly after their arrival they met Hideharu Onuma and began their study of kyudo. Later their relationship with Onuma sensei deepened when they moved into an apartment above the family archery equipment shop. In 1988 Dan DeProspero passed his examination for kyudo renshi (instructor's license). The following year he was promoted to 6th dan. Jackie DeProspero was the first non-Japanese woman to be promoted to kyudo 5th dan. <br><br>Cover photograph: TSUKAMOTO NAOKIYO, 12th-generation headmaster of the Heki Ryu Sekka-ha school of Japanese archery.<br></p><h2>Pnin</h2><p>Professor Timofey Pnin, previously of Tsarist Russia, is now precariously positioned at the heart of campus America. Battling with American life and language, Pnin must face great hazards in this new world: the ruination of his beautiful lumber-room-as-office; the removal of his teeth and the fitting of new ones; the search for a suitable boarding-house; and, the trials of taking the wrong train.</p><p>One of the best-loved of Nabokov's novels, PNIN features his funniest and most heartrending character. Professor Timofey Pnin is a haplessly disoriented Russian emigre precariously employed on an American college campus in the 1950s. Pnin struggles to maintain his dignity through a series of comic and sad misunderstandings, all the while falling victim both to subtle academic conspiracies and to the manipulations of a deliberately unreliable narrator. <br>Initially an almost grotesquely comic figure, Pnin gradually grows in stature by contrast with those who laugh at him. Whether taking the wrong train to deliver a lecture in a language he has not mastered or throwing a faculty party during which he learns he is losing his job, the gently preposterous hero of this enchanting novel evokes the reader's deepest protective instinct. <br>Serialized in "The New Yorker and published in book form in 1957, PNIN" brought Nabokov both his first National Book Award nomination and hitherto unprecedented popularity.&#34;Nabokov writes prose the only way it should be written, that is, ecstatically.&#34; -- John Updike</p><h2>Margaret Mitchell&#39;s Gone With the Wind: A Bestseller&#39;s Odyssey from Atlanta to Hollywood</h2><p>Margaret Mitchell&#39;s Gone With the Wind: A Bestseller&#39;s Odyssey from Atlanta to Hollywood presents the first comprehensive overview of how this iconic novel became an international phenomenon that has managed to sustain the public&#39;s interest for 75 years.

The translator has managed to retain the poet's moral tone while purging any taint of sententiousness. How? By recasting the structure of "Carpe Diem," for example, he gives this familiar poem a power one would have not thought possible. Ferry even manages a Latin-English rhyme at the end, by shifting the position of the addressee's name: "Leuconoe-- / Hold on to the day."<p> Ferry's Horace is always a specific personality, with his own identity, background, and attitude. Yet he is also a conduit of history. Turning to "<i>Delicta maiorum immeritus lues...</i>" (which Ferry straightforwardly calls "To the Romans"), we are plunged into a devastating meditation on the imperium. At this point, of course, it's commonplace to point out similarities between the American empire and that of ancient Rome. But this translation gives us a feeling for just how contemporary Horace really is. The best example would probably be "To Dellius": </p><blockquote> Dellius, don't be<br> Too unrestrainedly joyful in good fortune.<br> You are going to die.<br> <p> It doesn't matter at all whether you spend<br> Your days and nights in sorrow,<br> Or, on the other hand, in holiday pleasure.<br> Drinking Falernian wine<br> </p><p> Of an excellent vintage year, on the river bank.<br> </p></blockquote> It helps to know that the historical Dellius was exiled in Egypt at the time, making those Italian vintages strictly off-limits to him. What's more, he was a double or perhaps triple agent, which gives him an additional Cold War coloration. In any case, the allusiveness of the odes--and the taut, bone-dry English of Ferry's translation--should gain Horace a legion or so of new readers. <i>--Mark Rudman</i>Text: English, Latin (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: World War I</h2><p>Now in Paperback! <p>Updated and revised to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War, <i>Eyewitness World War I</i> takes an in-depth look at the battles fought, the weapons used, and the lives lost.

Kreeft calls it &#x201c;the Magna Carta of philosophy,&#x201d; a timeless classic that is &#x201c;a portable classroom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If only every introductory course were as engaging as<i> Philosophy 101 </i>by Peter Kreeft! Kreeft offers a marvelous way of using Plato&#x2019;s Apology both to introduce the whole scope of philosopher and to evoke a personal response. Even the diffident freshman, prone to keeping a new subject like philosopher as arm&#x2019;s length, will feel the enchantment of love-for-wisdom that philosophy is supposed to be.&#x201d; &#x2013; Joseph W. Koterski, S.J., chair, Department of Philosophy, Fordham University</p><p>&#x201c;A terrific introduction to philosophy through this not uncontroversial commentary on Plato&#x2019;s Apology. Not everyone will agree that Socrates provided the best possible defense for himself nor that he intended to. But Kreeft&#x2019;s is an eminently defensible reading of the Apology and will awaken many a student to the delights of Plato and Philosophy. The comparisons of Socrates with Christ are fascinating. This book will go a long way to consoling those who are not privileged to have Socrates or Kreeft as teachers in the flesh.&#x201d; &#x2013; Janet Smith, Sacred Heart Major Seminary, Detroit<br></p></p><h2>Bastiat&#39;s &#34;The Law&#34; (Occasional Paper, 123)</h2><p>Frederic Bastiat, who was born two hundred years ago, was a leader of the French laissez-faire tradition in the first half of the nineteenth century. He was influenced by Cobden's Anti-Corn Law League and became a convinced free trader. Joseph Schumpeter described Bastiat as 'the most brilliant economic journalist who ever lived'. In <i>The Law</i>, written in 1850, the year of his death, Bastiat recognises the central importance of the law and morality in a free society. He was concerned that government was using the 'law' to become too active a participant in the economy whilst devoting too little attention to protecting life and liberty. This Occasional Paper, which reprints an English translation of <i>The Law</i>, includes a new introduction by Professor Norman Barry of the University of Buckingham which places Bastiat's views in their historical context and explains their continuing relevance today.</p><p><p><b>Norman Barry</b> was a professor of politics at the University of Buckingham.<i></i></p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>How to Buy Stocks</h2><p>A new edition of a classic stock market guide offers clear explanations and reasonable and understandable advice on investments, updating information to cover new regulations and new opportunities. 30,000 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>Steadfast</h2><p><b>The eighth novel in Mercedes Lackey's magical Elemental Masters series reimagines the fairy tale The Steadfast Tin Soldier in a richly-detailed alternate Victorian England</b><br><br>Katie Langford had been part of her family&#x2019;s acrobatic troupe working in a small traveling circus&#x2014;until a terrible fire killed her parents. Years later, still with the circus but stuck in an abusive marriage, Katie fled from her increasingly dangerous husband to Brighton. As a seaside resort town, Brighton&#x2019;s music halls meant no circus needed to visit. It was as safe a place as she could find. <br> &nbsp;<br> Lionel Hawkins was a professional magician who had a permanent job at the Palace Music Hall in Brighton. His shows never failed to enchant the ever-changing crowds, for his magic was more than just tricks. Lionel was an Air Magician, and he wasn&#x2019;t the only one at the Palace who had magical abilities. Jack Prescott, the Palace doorman who had lost a leg in the Boer Wars, had preternatural awareness of all flame, which had saved the Palace from burning on more than one occasion. <br> &nbsp;<br> When Katie answered the Palace&#x2019;s call for a new assistant with stage experience, it seemed like all her problems were solved. But it soon became clear that Katie was a Fire Magician like Jack and that something had blocked Katie&#x2019;s access to her own abilities&#x2014;a dangerous situation for everyone around her. Fire, the most volatile of all the elements, was a power that could easily turn deadly when fueled by strong emotion. And Lionel and Jack could tell that Katie was hiding something. Something that frightened her. Something that could set their whole world ablaze if they couldn&#x2019;t help her master her Element in time.</p><p><b>Mercedes Lackey</b>&nbsp;is a full-time writer and has published numerous novels and works of short fiction, including the best-selling Heralds of Valdemar series.

It took her a moment of paralyzed fear to realize that she was not in the circus wagon, she was not about to be beaten by her husband again, and at least for this moment she was safe. Safe, sleeping on a sort of shelf-bed in old Mary Small&#x2019;s <i>vardo</i>, protected by the menfolk sleeping outside. She could hear their snores from underneath her, sheltered by the great Traveler wagon, and from the bender tents around the wagon.</p><p>She took slow, careful breaths as her heart quieted, and she felt her emotions fall back into the curious state of numb apprehension that she couldn&#x2019;t seem to work her way out of. She wondered if she would ever feel normal again&#x2014;or happy?</p><p><i>Probably not until I know that Dick is dead. </i></p><p>She listened to the snores. Mary Small had outlived her husband, but her sons and grandsons were many, and since Mary had declared that the half-blooded Katie was to be sheltered and protected, her sons would see to it that their mother&#x2019;s word was followed. This was . . . interesting. Her mother might have married a <i>gadjo</i>, she might be <i>didicoy</i>, and Katie herself might know no more than a few words of the Traveler tongue, but still, it seemed that for Mary Small, blood was blood.</p><p>Perhaps it was something more than that, for Mary had declared she was <i>drabarni</i>, she had magic, and so she was to be doubly protected.</p><p>Katie could not for a moment imagine where Mary had gotten that idea. Magic? The only magic she had ever seen was sleight of hand and outright fraud. Her mother had told her stories of magic . . . but if Katie&#x2019;d had anything like what had been in those stories . . .</p><p><i>My parents would be alive</i>, she thought, and swallowed down tears. <i>If I&#x2019;d had that sort of magic, they would be alive.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie breathed slowly and carefully in the spice-redolent darkness of the <i>vardo</i>, waiting for the tears to pass, the numbness to settle in again. It was only three days ago she had taken everything portable she had of value and fled the circus&#x2014;but it seemed an entire lifetime ago. She still could hardly believe that she&#x2019;d had the temerity. <i>That </i>Katie, who&#x2019;d resolutely taken everything that was due her and run, seemed a stranger to her. After months of being married to Dick, she had turned into a terrified mouse of a creature, afraid to put a single finger wrong. Where had that courage come from? She still didn&#x2019;t know . . . but it hadn&#x2019;t lasted for more than the few hours it took to put some distance between her and the circus.</p><p>Once it had run out, then she&#x2019;d settled into the state of dull anxiety she lived in now. But she had kept going, understanding that after having run, being caught would be&#x2014;a horror. She didn&#x2019;t dare even think about what Dick would do to her if he caught her.</p><p>It had been only a day since she had stumbled on the Traveler encampment&#x2014;literally ran right into it, since the <i>vardos</i> of the Small clan were Bow Tops, painted to blend in with the woodland rather than stand out like the bright red and gold Reading <i>vardos</i>. The entire two days before, she had been running, mostly along country lanes and paths through forest, changing her direction at random. Her husband Dick&#x2014;and more especially, Andy Ball, the owner of Ball&#x2019;s Circus&#x2014;would most likely assume she would head for one of the nearest towns rather than take to the countryside. They didn&#x2019;t know her at all, nor had they ever made any effort to know her. They would assume she was like the other women of the circus, who knew only the wagons, the tents, and the towns.</p><p>Dick would be furious, not only because she, his possession, had dared to run from him, but because she had picked the lock on his strongbox and taken every bit of the money <i>she</i> had earned. Or at least, every bit that was left after his drinking; she took only what should have been her salary, and there was still money left in the strongbox when she closed it again.</p><p>It was not as if he actually needed her money. The truth was, he generally didn&#x2019;t have to pay for drinks, though he was quite a heavy drinker. Locals in the pubs would buy him rounds just to see his tricks, like unbending and rebending a horseshoe, or tying an iron bar into a knot. He didn&#x2019;t have to pay for whores, either, with farmer&#x2019;s lasses throwing themselves at him.</p><p>She wouldn&#x2019;t have cared about that. She <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>care about that. She&#x2019;d only married him because he&#x2019;d been craftily kind to her after the horrible fire that killed her parents, and because Andy Ball said she had to marry a strong man to protect her now, and who was stronger than the Strong Man himself? She&#x2019;d been so paralyzed with grief, mind fogged, so alone . . . Andy had been so insistent . . . it had seemed logical. Most marriages among circus folks were arranged, anyway&#x2014;an acrobat daughter sent into a family of ropewalkers, or off to learn trapeze work. So she&#x2019;d gone along with it, and found herself married to a man who at first was impatient with nearly everything she did, then increasingly angry with her, then who knocked her around whenever something displeased him.</p><p>Of course, it hadn&#x2019;t been bad at first. A slap here, a push there&#x2014;circus folk were not always the kindest to each other and plenty of husbands and wives left marks on each other after fights. Circus folk drank, and there were often fights.</p><p>She&#x2019;d gone in despair to Andy Ball, who had shrugged, and said &#x201c;Then take pains to please him, he&#x2019;s your husband, you must do as he says. I told him if he broke your bones, he&#x2019;d be answering to me, so stop your whingeing.&#x201d; And for the longest time, she had believed that it was her fault. After all, her mother and father had never done more than shout at each other. And none of the other circus wives were ever treated as she was. She&#x2019;d been too ashamed to talk to any of the other women about it, especially when he began to really beat her.</p><p>Why had Andy urged the marriage on her? Because Dick wanted her and he was handing her over like some reward for loyalty? Because he was afraid to lose his chief dancer and contortionist?</p><p>She&#x2019;d been part of a three-man acrobatic act; her mother, her father, and herself. It had been like that for as long as she had been alive. With her family gone, besides her dancing in the circus ballet, and her contortions in the sideshow, Andy had come up with a new act for her. She became part of Dick&#x2019;s strongman act, with tricks like standing on her hands while balanced on Dick&#x2019;s palm, and shivering the whole time, afraid he&#x2019;d drop her. She would have liked to join some other act, but Dick forbade it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll work with me or no one,&#x201d; he said, in that tone of voice that made her shake and imagine that no one meant he&#x2019;d strangle her in her sleep.</p><p>It was only when she&#x2019;d been bathing in a stream&#x2014;she usually did that alone, to hide the bruises&#x2014;and some of the other women had come on her unexpectedly that she had finally been forced to confront the truth. They&#x2019;d been alarmed, then angry, then&#x2014;afraid. Because while, one and all, they told her that <i>this wasn&#x2019;t right</i>, they also told her she would have to somehow get away on her own. No one dared challenge Dick. He could snap any other man&#x2019;s neck without thinking about it.</p><p>At least their words had snapped her out of the fugue of despair and fear, and gave her the courage and the strength to run. The opportunity had come when a lot of rich men had descended on Dick and plied him with drink far stronger than he was used to. He&#x2019;d been so dead drunk that nothing would have awakened him, giving her plenty of time to pack up all her belongings, steal the money, and get a good head start on him. As a child she&#x2019;d been a woods-runner, and in summer, her parents had often spent entire weeks camped out, hidden, on someone&#x2019;s private land, living off it. Unlike Dick, she didn&#x2019;t need a town to survive. But she was counting on the idea that he would think she did.</p><p>It had been while she was following a path through the woods on some lord&#x2019;s enormous estate that she had stumbled on the Travelers. The old woman had started with surprise as she appeared in their midst. She&#x2019;d snapped out a few commands from the porch of her <i>vardo</i> in the Traveler tongue, and one of the young men had seized Katie&#x2019;s wrist before she could run.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be afraid,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told her, in a lightly accented, warm voice that caressed like velvet. &#x201c;<i>Puri daj</i> has seen you are of the blood. She says you are <i>drabarni</i>, and that you are afraid and running. We will hide you.&#x201d;</p><p>The accent, and the words, straight out of her childhood, when her mother had whispered Traveler words to her, had somehow stolen her fear away&#x2014;and besides, at that point she was exhausted and starving. Cress, a few berries, and mushrooms she had gathered had not done much for her hunger. The old woman had directed that she be brought to the fire, given an enormous bowl of rabbit stew, and draped with a warm shawl. She&#x2019;d fallen asleep where she was when the bowl was empty. They&#x2019;d woken her enough to guide her into the <i>vardo</i>, where she&#x2019;d fallen asleep on a little pallet on the floor. When night fell, one of the women had awakened her and pulled down this shelf-bed, which she had climbed into to fall asleep immediately again. It was narrow and short, and must have been intended for a child, but she was small and it fit her.</p><p>Today she&#x2019;d been given things to do&#x2014;mending Mary Small&#x2019;s clothing, since the old woman&#x2019;s eyes were too dim to thread a needle now&#x2014;and wash pots and dishes, freeing another of the women to go out and forage in the forest. The men went out and came back with food and word that the circus folk had passed through the village, asked if anyone had seen a girl like her, and moved on without stopping to set up.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re in Aleford,&#x201d; one of the boys, last in, had reported. &#x201c;Set up there. Moving on in the morning.&#x201d; He had eyed her, then. &#x201c;What did you do, that made you run?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My husband beat me,&#x201d; she had told him, the first time she had told anyone but Andy Ball, the shameful words surprised out of her. He had told her never to tell. He had told her she deserved it. Even now, it was almost easier to believe he was right, he&#x2019;d said it so often.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; the boy had said, and spat to the side. &#x201c;A curse on a bully that strikes a woman, unless with wanton ways or shrewish tongue she drives him to it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The <i>drabarni</i> is neither wanton nor shrew,&#x201d; Mary had proclaimed from the porch of the <i>vardo</i>, though how on earth she could know anything about Katie . . .</p><p>Her words settled things, it seemed, for the boy spat to the side again and repeated his curse, without the conditions this time.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it you do with the circus?&#x201d; someone else asked. So far none of them but Mary had told her their names, but it was one of the four other women in this clan.</p><p>To answer that, she showed them, bending over backward and grabbing her ankles with her hands, straightening up again and going into a series of cartwheels so fast that her skirts never dropped to show her legs at all. &#x201c;And I dance,&#x201d; she had added simply as she finished back where she had started and clasped her hands in front of her.</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Mary had nodded. &#x201c;Then you can do that while the boys play music. And we will teach you your mother&#x2019;s dances. You have the Gitano look about you and we are Gitano. Now it is time to eat.&#x201d;</p><p>And now she was spending her second night under the canvas top of Mary&#x2019;s <i>vardo</i>, which seemed to be the place they had decided she was to stay. At this point she was content to do what they told her to. It wasn&#x2019;t only her body that was exhausted, it was her mind.</p><p>A rumble of thunder in the distance suggested what it was that had woken her; a moment later a gentle rain pattered down on the canvas top of the <i>vardo</i>. There was a curtain she could use to draw across the front of her shelf, and she did so. A moment later three of the boys came up the stairs, their bedrolls over their shoulders. They squeezed themselves together on the floor, and before she would have believed it possible, they were asleep again, on their sides, arranged like spoons in a drawer.</p><p>And the rain lulled Katie back to sleep, secure in the presence of her protectors beyond the gently waving curtain.</p></p><h2>Gilded Leaf: Triumph, Tragedy, and Tobacco : Three Generations of the R J Reynolds Family and Fortune</h2><p>Chronicles the tribulations and legendary excesses of the Reynolds tobacco family, from patriarch R.J. Reynolds, to his two playboy sons, Dick and Smith, down to Dick&#39;s children</p><p>Patrick Reynolds is a grandson of R. J. Reynolds, and has become a leading anti-smoking advocate. In 1989, Mr. Reynolds founded the Foundation for a Smokefree America, a nonprofit group whose mission is to motivate youth to stay tobacco free and to empower smokers to quit. For more information, please visit www.anti-smoking.org.Critically acclaimed author Tom Shachtman has written more than two dozen books and many television documentaries. For more details, see his website, www.tomshachtman.com.Readers of this captivating account of the R. J. Reynolds tobacco clan may need to remind themselves that it is not fiction. There are colorful characters, a family rising from humble be ginnings to attain fabulous wealth and power, scandal and tragedy wrought by excess--and an irony-laden finale. Concentrating on the period from the turn of the century to the present, but going back as far as 1828, Reynolds, grandson of R. J., and Schactman ( The Phony War ) explore the workings of a family whose success was a major contributor to the anguish of some of its members. Among these are Dick Reynolds, quintessential Jazz Age playboy who married four times and died of the combined effects of using alcohol and tobacco; Smith Reynolds, daredevil pilot who flew around the world, married twice and died of a gunshot wound--possibly inflicted by his wife--at age 20; and R. J. (Richard Joshua), shrewd, remarkably civic-minded paterfamilias who built the family fortune. Coauthor-descendant Reynolds has put a nice twist on the family history by becoming a crusader for the anti-smoking movement.

She was tall, slim, and graceful with a regal tilt to her chin. With every step she took, the flounces of her pale yellow pelisse fluttered like delicate leaves caught on a summer wind. From beneath her fetching, short-brimmed straw hat, he saw ringlets of gorgeous red curls framing her beautiful face.</p> <p>Matson had always been attracted to redheads.</p> <p>He had attended more parties than he could count during the six months he'd been in London and was certain he'd never seen her before. She must have just arrived in Town for the Season.</p> <p>She was flanked by a pair of older women who looked so much alike they could have been bookends. Though they each wore a different color, their dresses and bonnets were made from the same pattern. Matson knew at once they had to be sisters and maybe even twins, but his gaze didn't linger on the matrons. It was the younger lady who commanded his attention.</p> <p>Matson couldn't help but think she must be the daughter of a powerful duke or an earl to have such severe-looking chaperones on either side. The lovely belle was at least half a head taller than her prim escorts, and they all carried fancy ruffled-and-beribboned parasols over their shoulders.</p> <p>His pulse raced when the young lady caught sight of him. He bowed, as was custom, though an observant onlooker would note the restraint, as if he hadn't spent his life bowing in London streets. When he lifted his head, their gazes met once again, and she returned his smile. A slow throb started in his loins. There was a sensuous quality to her full lips, and an amusing twinkle in her eyes that beckoned him.</p> <p>When she was only a short distance from him, Matson heard a man yell, "Stop that thief!"</p> <p>A second later a lad of about eight or nine years of age rushed in front of the three ladies, shoving one of them aside and almost knocking her down. The incident slowed the boy just enough for the shopkeeper to grab the back of his tattered coat and stop him.</p> <p>"You little bandit!" the portly merchant yelled and almost lifted the boy off the ground by the neck of his shirt. "I'll teach you to steal from me."</p> <p>The young lady broke away from the two women at her side and rushed to the boy's aid.</p> <p>"Put him down," she commanded. "That's no way to treat a child."</p> <p>"I'll do no such thing," the man barked, his expression blazing with barely controlled rage. "It's the second time this week he's stolen a loaf of bread from me."</p> <p>"He's holding nothing," she protested, her tone full of challenge.</p> <p>"That's because the little imp threw it aside when I gave chase."</p> <p>"He is probably hungry," she answered, continuing her defense of the street urchin whose face, hands, and clothing were smeared with grime and coal dust.</p> <p>"Sophia, you must not get involved in this," one of her chaperones said breathlessly. "This is not our quarrel. We must go."</p> <p>Sophia.</p> <p>So now he had a name for the lovely young lady.</p> <p>"Not yet, Aunt June. I'll not stand by and watch anyone this small be treated so violently." She turned to the man again. "Release him."</p> <p>Matson admired the young lady's display of courage and determination to help the impish lad and was impressed by the way she took the bellowing trader to task. Obviously others were too. A small crowd was gathering around them to watch.</p> <p>"He deserves far worse," the shopkeeper muttered without backing down on his firm stance.</p> <p>"Not from you, he doesn't," she answered quickly.</p> <p>Matson wasn't the kind of man to stand by for long and let the young lady take up for the lad all by herself. He wasn't very familiar with London streets, but in Baltimore, some shopkeepers put out baskets of stale bread by their door each morning where street scamps could help themselves without fear of punishment. It was the charitable thing to do, and it kept most of the youth from pilfering the fresh-baked loaves put out later in the day.</p> <p>"I'll pay for the bread," Matson said, stepping closer to the group and reaching into his coat pocket for a coin.</p> <p>The young lady gave Matson a grateful smile, and his stomach tightened with desire. There was something infinitely rewarding about aiding a pretty lady and receiving her gratitude.</p> <p>"Such a nice thing to do for the lad," he heard one of her chaperones murmur softly.</p> <p>"Hush, Mae," the other lady said. "This is not our concern. Sophia needs to stop this nonsense and come with us immediately."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, of course you're right, Sister."</p> <p>Matson looked back to the shopkeeper. "Take this, and the bread will be more than paid for both days. Now do as the lady asked and let him go."</p> <p>There was a moment of tense silence before the irate man turned the lad loose. "Yes, it's paid for today, yesterday, and maybe a bit more for times past," he grumbled, grabbing the coin with stubby fingers and squeezing it in his beefy palm. "But what will I do about tomorrow or the next day when he comes back?"</p> <p>"I will not be here to help him." Matson peered down at the dirty-faced rascal, whose big, expressive brown eyes showed no fear. His calmness was unusual for one so young and in his predicament. That told Matson the lad was no stranger to trouble. He was probably used to being manhandled, and it obviously wasn't the first time he'd been caught helping himself to food he hadn't paid for.</p> <p>"I'd say that's a good thing," the merchant said. "He needs to be taught a lesson."</p> <p>The young lady bristled again. "What would you do? Thrash him? You are more than three times his size. He is only a hungry child."</p> <p>"He is a thief," the man growled malevolently.</p> <p>"Stop this," one of the aunts said sternly, taking hold of Sophia's upper arm. "I insist that we go now. This is not any of your concern and not a place you should be."</p> <p>"Wait," she said.</p> <p>"No, Sophia, June is right. We are drawing a crowd of onlookers. We must go now."</p> <p>Sophia acted as if she hadn't heard her companions and didn't make a move to back down from the shopkeeper's angry glare and harsh accusation.</p> <p>"Where is your benevolent spirit for one so young?" she asked the man as she tried to shake off June's tight hold on her arm.</p> <p>"I suppose he robbed me of that too," the merchant shot back.</p> <p>Matson didn't want to lecture anyone, but in this case, felt he had to do more to settle this dispute. The trader was obviously looking for punishment for the lad to go with the payment Matson gave him, and Sophia was determined the child simply be set free.</p> <p>Looking down at the boy's smudged but innocent-looking face, Matson said, "You may not be so lucky to have someone come to your aid next time. You'd best not try your hand at stealing again. If you need food-just ask for it. I'm sure this man would be willing to give you a job or two to do around his store to pay for some bread." He looked up at the merchant. "Do you agree?"</p> <p>"I'll not be promising this scamp anything," he muttered and stomped down the walkway.</p> <p>Matson returned his attention to the captivating young lady named Sophia. He was intrigued by her and attracted by the sparkle in her bright green eyes. He was downright tantalized by the dusky pink tint to her inviting lips. There was a faint sprinkling of tiny freckles that swept across the bridge of her nose and fanned her cheekbones. Matson had an instant desire to kiss his way over them. He knew her skin would be warm, smooth, and soft to his touch.</p> <p>She fixed her gaze on his, and Matson's heartbeat leaped. His gaze followed the graceful curve of her chin, drifting down to the pulse in the hollow of her throat. She wasn't giving him smiles laced with promises or sensuous glances, but every cell in his body responded to her. He could see that, even though she'd boldly taken up for the lad, she was every bit a soft, feminine lady. Matson's body was making him quite aware of just how long it had been since a woman had truly interested him.</p> <p>Suddenly, one of the older women gasped. Matson glanced down in time to see the boy swipe a knife across the strings of the young lady's reticule and grab it as it fell from her wrist.</p> <p>The crested-hilt dagger the mischievous youngster used looked like Matson's!</p> <p>His hand flew to his empty holder. How had the little bugger filched it from the belt around Matson's waist without his awareness? He reached for the rascal, but the only thing his hand closed around was air.</p> <p>"You little cutpurse!" he called and took off after the artful thief, who was pushing, bumping, and tripping people in his haste to get away.</p> <p>Matson had to slow down and sidestep bystanders to keep from running them down. With ease, the boy took a quick, sharp right turn and deliberately toppled a large table that was piled high with breads, cheeses, and meat pies as he flew by it. Matson moved quickly to keep from taking a tumble himself as he jumped over loaves, kicked rounds of cheese, and stepped squarely into the middle of a savory pie. He heard a shopkeeper yelling from behind him, but Matson kept running. It was more important that he catch the lad than help the merchant with his ruined food items.</p> <p>A few seconds later, Matson was gaining on the boy when suddenly the boy rounded another corner. Matson was right behind him, but pulled up short at the sight before him. He sucked in a deep, cold breath and caught the strong scent of fish.</p> <p>It was market day, and every inch of Timsford's Square was covered with street vendors, shoppers, and merrymakers. Tables, carts, and stalls were filled with everything from meats, flowers, and spices, to fabrics, trinkets, and embroidery samples. Hundreds of people were happily milling around in the festival-like atmosphere, looking, bartering, and buying from the wares available.</p> <p>Matson let out a heavy sigh. Maybe he could have found the lad in the throng of people if the scamp had been the only child on the street, but to Matson it looked as if there were at least as many children as adults in the crowd teeming before him.</p> <p>"Damnation," he swore softly, angry with himself for letting the little rascal outsmart him, and outrun him. He took off his hat and wiped his forehead with the back of his palm.</p> <p>"Where is he? Where did he go?"</p> <p>Matson heard the frantic voice beside him, and his attention jerked away from the square. He once again drank in the details of the red-haired beauty who had stopped beside him. Her chest rose and fell rapidly. The spring chill had colored her cheeks in a delicate rosy color, and her breath blew soft puffs of warm mist into the noisy air. Matson wanted to lower his mouth to her parted lips and mingle his own breath with hers.</p> <p>In Sophia's haste to catch up with him, her bonnet had fallen off her head and lay on her back. Midafternoon sunlight streamed down and glistened on thick golden-red hair that looked as if it had been intertwined with shimmering tresses spun from gold. His stomach knotted in anticipation. He had an almost irresistible urge to release her lush hair from its combs right there on the busy street and bury his face in the silken torrent of lavish curls.</p> <p>Matson mentally shook himself. He hadn't been so instantly attracted to a lady since he'd first met Mrs. Catherine Delaney when he was twenty years old. She'd had golden-red locks too. She had been the desire of his dreams for two years, but he hadn't thought about her in a long time.</p> <p>Reluctantly, he tore his interest from Sophia's hair to concentrate on her features. Concern clouded her eyes, dulling the spark that had been there just minutes before. Obviously, she didn't like being bested by the lad any more than he did.</p> <p>"I lost sight of him in the square," Matson said, unable to hide his frustration at being fooled by the youngster's wily escape.</p> <p>A look of fiery determination flashed across her face. "I must find him."</p> <p>"That's going to be difficult to do in that mob."</p> <p>Her hands balled into tight fists. "I can't believe I was so gullible. I defended him and tried to help him."</p> <p>Her troubled expression showed a hint of the sudden turmoil he heard in her voice. "We were both taken in by his innocent young face," Matson admitted. "He probably ran through the square at such a speed that he is way down one of the side streets by now."</p> <p>"No, there he is," she exclaimed and took off running toward a child.</p> <p>"Wait!" Matson called and ran after her. "That's not him."</p> <p>Before he could reach her, she grabbed a young boy by the shoulders and turned him around. The frightened child looked up at her and tried to pull away.</p> <p>"'Ey there, whatcha doing wid me son?" a large, apron-clad woman called and started stomping toward Sophia.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, letting go of him and looking at the woman. "Excuse me. I thought he was someone else."</p> <p>Sophia spun away from the kid and started searching the crowd again. Fearing what she intended to do, Matson tried to catch up to her, but before he could reach her, he saw her gaze light on another boy who looked like the thief.</p> <p>She raced toward the lad and quickly turned him around. It was not the imp.</p> <p>"Get yer hands off me boy," a woman yelled and shoved Sophia away.</p> <p>Matson saw big trouble brewing if he didn't get Sophia away from the square. He touched her arm. "Miss, he's not here. We need to go."</p> <p>She paid him no mind. Her gaze frantically searched the crowd again as her hands squeezed the fabric of her skirt. "He has to be here," she whispered earnestly.</p> <p>"He's already gone. Come with me," Matson said, noticing that several men and women were slowly closing in on them.</p> <p>"I can't leave. I must find him."</p> <p>Matson sensed she had more at stake than just a purse with an embroidered handkerchief in it, but this was not the way to find her reticule. He took hold of her wrist and calmly said, "We'll return later, but right now you're coming with me." He started pulling her away from the crowd.</p> <p>"No. Let go of me."</p> <p>She tried to pry his hand from around her wrist, but he held tightly and kept walking.</p> <p>"You don't understand. I must find him."</p> <p>Matson didn't look back until he managed to get her a safe distance away from the square. When he let her go, she glared at him.</p> <p>"Who do you think you are? You had no right to interfere, no right to touch me. Now, thanks to you, the boy will get away."</p> <p>Matson grimaced. "Thanks to me? The boy had already run away. I was trying to find him too."</p> <p>"Then why did you stop me from looking for him?"</p> <p>Matson was determined to be patient. She was flushed, out of breath, and not thinking clearly. "Didn't you see the way most everyone in the crowd was staring at you? You were about to find yourself in big trouble for accosting their sons."</p> <p>"Accosting?" she asked impetuously. "Don't be ri...</p></p><h2>Notes on the Parables of Our Lord</h2><p>This historic book may have numerous typos and missing text. Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1853. Excerpt: ... INTRODUCTORY ESSAY. CHAPTER I. ON THE DEFINITION OF THE PARABLE. rPHOSE writers who have had occasion to define a parable--have found it no easy task to give such a satisfying definition as should omit none of its distinctive marks, and yet at the same time should include nothing that was superfluous and merely accidental. Rather than attempt to add another to the many definitions already given, f I will seek to note Hapafidrj, from irapafiaWfiv, projicere, objicere, i. e. rl run, to put forth one thing before or beside another; and it is assumed, when wapaBofi is used for parable, though not necessarily included in the word, that the purpose for which they are set side by side is, that they may be compared one with the other; thus Polyb., L i. c. 2. ï¿½ 2, Tiapaj3orj Kai aiyKpurit. That this is not necessarily included is clear, not only from the derivation, but from the fact that the word itself and the whole family of cognate words, as irapd/SoXos, irapafioas, parabolanus, are used in altogether a different sense, yet one growing out of the same root, in which the notion of putting forth is retained, but it is no longer for the purpose of comparison, which is only the accident, not of the essence of the word. Thus irapa/SoXoy, qui objicit se prsesentissimo vita; periculo, one who exposes his life, as those at Alexandria called parabolani, because they buried infected corpses.--The chief Latin writers are not agreed in their rendering of the word. Cicero (De Inv. Rhet., 1. i. c. 30) represents it by collatio; Seneca (Ep. 59) by imago; Quintilian (Inst., 5. 11. 8) by similitudo. t Many from the Greek Fathers are to be found in Suiceb&#39;s Thes., s.v. irapafioij.

Here he presents a radical alternative to conventional woodland management that creates biodiverse, healthy environments, yields a great variety of value-added products, provides a secure livelihood for woodland workers and farmers, and benefits the local community. The author views the separation of agriculture from silviculture as unnecessarily limiting and argues for a new approach to planning that will encourage the creation of sustainably managed woodlands for the benefit of people, the local environment, and the global climate. Although specific to Britain, the principles of <em>The Woodland Way</em> will be understood by foresters worldwide.</p> <p>This brilliant book covers every aspect of woodland stewardship from both a practical and philosophical standpoint. Ben Law writes from the heart after long years of struggle with a whole host of naysayers who tried to convince him by fair means and foul to give up his vision for a renaissance in the countryside.</p></p><p><p>Ben Law trains apprentices and runs courses on sustainable woodland management, roundwood timber framing, coppice crafts, and permaculture design. He was a founding member of the Forest Stewardship Council. He also has worked for Oxfam as a permaculture consultant.

When Ariane and her friend and teacher Sylvie perform a mysterious ritual in the woods in the dead of night, Sylvie suddenly vanishes "into the dark beyond." Ariane sets off with an inscrutable child called Craobh and a tinker to find her companion and restore the universe to rights. Unnecessarily convoluted, this novel offers the reader little incentive to unravel overwritten prose that tries to pass for profound. One passage opens: "Half waking in the night, Ariane thought that Sylvie wound and wound the skein of autumn from her hands. Cloudwarp, said the dream: and moonwise, turn and turn about, they span the whorled and knotted stuff." And so the story drags on, leaving one with the indelible impression that Gilman's bag of wizardry gimmicks (such as the appearance of a demon or witch) and pointless linguistic tricks (like using the name of the epic hero Gilgamesh as an adverb--"She went slowly, gilgamesh, gilgamesh . . ."p. 185 ) represents little more than a futile effort to disguise this novel's lack of genuine creativity. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Narrow boat</h2><p>Written by a renowned expert on canals and founder of the Inland Waterways Association, this title guides the reader from the Grand Union Canal to Lichfield and Coventry Canal.</p><p>L.

But Grateful Dead devotees should think in terms of its per-pound price. Tipping the scales at over 15 pounds, it's priced more like hamburger than steak. Make no mistake, however--this is a porterhouse of a book. Weighty, lushly illustrated, and thorough, the collaboration (spearheaded by longtime band publicist Dennis McNally and stalwart Dead chronicler Blair Jackson, among others) is constructed around an annotated timeline that runs from the 1940 birth of the band's oldest member, Phil Lesh, (the following notation concerns the assassination of Leon Trotsky) through the Dead comeback shows of the summer of 2003. Striving to capture the tenor of the times as well as the development of the group, vignettes capture seemingly everyone and everything that came into the orbit of Jerry Garcia and company, from the rise of the underground press through the links between the Dead and hip-hop nations (which pretty much begin and end with a shared affection for weed). Great fun to scan and visually dizzying (thanks to more than 2,000 photos and other pieces of artwork), this is the Dead coffee table book to end all Dead coffee table books. <i>--Steven Stolder</i>The Dead book is a group project put together by the likes of Dennis McNally, author of <i>A Long Strange Trip</i> [BKL Ag 02], and Blair Jackson, editor of the fondly remembered GD fanzine <i>The Golden Road</i>. Augmenting their efforts are a rambling time line constructed by rock scribe Chuck Willis, many boxed features, lotsa colorful illustrations, and capsule descriptions of standout Dead shows as selected by "proto-taper" and Dead discographer Ihor Slabicky, whose criteria were "long extended jams" and "uniqueness" rather than historic considerations. Coverage runs from the earliest performances of the Warlocks (the band's earlier name) through the Grateful Dead years and on to the band's two post-Jerry Garcia incarnations, the Other Ones and the Dead.

His monthly medical report is critical of the high living that is ruining his health, and M packs him off for a fortnight to a nature-cure clinic to be tuned-up to his former pitch of exceptional fitness.</p><p><p>Ian Fleming (1908-1964), creator of the world's best-known secret agent, is the author of fourteen James Bond books. Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><p><b>1. 'TAKE IT EASY, MR BOND'</b></p> <p>It was one of those days when it seemed to James Bond that all life, as someone put it, was nothing but a heap of six to four against.</p> <p>To begin with he was ashamed of himself - a rare state of mind. He had a hangover, a bad one, with an aching head and stiff joints. When he coughed -smoking too much goes with drinking too much and doubles the hangover - a cloud of small luminous black spots swam across his vision like amoebae in pond water. The one drink too many signals itself unmistakably. His final whisky and soda in the luxurious flat in Park Lane had been no different from the ten preceding ones, but it had gone down reluctantly and had left a bitter taste and an ugly sensation of surfeit. And, although he had taken in the message, he had agreed to play just one more rubber. Five pounds a hundred as it's the last one? He had agreed. And he had played the rubber like a fool. Even now he could see the queen of spades, with that stupid Mona Lisa smile on her fat face, slapping triumphantly down on his knave - the queen, as his partner had so sharply reminded him, that had been so infallibly marked with South, and that had made the difference between a grand slam redoubled (drunkenly) for him, and four hundred points above the line for the opposition. In the end it had been a twenty-point rubber, ï¿½100 against him - important money. &#x2014; Again Bond dabbed with the bloodstained styptic pencil at the cut on his chin and despised the face that stared sullenly back at him from the mirror above the washbasin. Stupid, ignorant bastard! It all came from having nothing to do. More than a month of paper-work - ticking off his number on stupid dockets, scribbling minutes that got spikier as the weeks passed, and snap-ping back down the telephone when some harmless section officer tried to argue with him. And then his secretary had gone down with the flu and he had been given a silly, and, worse, ugly bitch from the pool who called him 'sir' and spoke to him primly through a mouth full of fruit stones. And now it was another Monday morning. Another week was beginning. The May rain thrashed at the windows. Bond swallowed down two Phensics and reached for the Enos. The telephone in his bedroom rang. It was the loud ring of the direct line with Headquarters.</p> <p>James Bond, his heart thumping faster than it should have done, despite the race across London and a fretful wait for the lift to the eighth floor, pulled out the chair and sat down and looked across into the calm, grey, damnably clear eyes he knew so well. What could he read in them?</p> <p>'Good morning, James. Sorry to pull you along a bit early in the morning. Got a very full day ahead. Wanted to fit you in before the rush.'</p> <p>Bond's excitement waned minutely. It was never a good sign when M addressed him by his Christian name instead of by his number. This didn't look like a job - more like something personal. There was none of the tension in M's voice that heralded big, exciting news. M's expression was interested, friendly, almost benign. Bond said something noncommittal.</p> <p>'Haven't seen much of you lately, James. How have you been? Your health, I mean.' M picked up a sheet of paper, a form of some kind, from his desk, and held it as if preparing to read.</p> <p>Suspiciously, trying to guess what the paper said, what all this was about, Bond said, 'I'm all right, sir.'</p> <p>M said mildly, 'That's not what the MO thinks, James. Just had your last Medical. I think you ought to hear what he has to say.'</p> <p>Bond looked angrily at the back of the paper. Now what the hell! He said with control, 'Just as you say, sir.'</p> <p>M gave Bond a careful, appraising glance. He held the paper closer to his eyes. '"This officer",' he read, '"remains basically physically sound. Unfortunately his mode of life is not such as is likely to allow him to remain in this happy state. Despite many previous warnings, he admits to smoking sixty cigarettes a day. These are of a Balkan mixture with a higher nicotine content than the cheaper varieties. When not engaged upon strenuous duty, the officer's average daily consumption of alcohol is in the region of half a bottle of spirits of between sixty and seventy proof. On examination, there continues to be little definite sign of deterioration. The tongue is furred. The blood pressure a little raised at 160/90. The liver is not palpable. On the other hand, when pressed, the officer admits to frequent occipital headaches and there is spasm in the trapezius muscles and so-called 'fibrositis' nodules can be felt. I believe these symptoms to be due to this officer's mode of life. He is not responsive to the suggestion that over-indulgence is no remedy for the tensions inherent in his professional calling and can only result in the creation of a toxic state which could finally have the effect of reducing his fitness as an officer. I recommend that No 007 should take it easy for two to three weeks on a more abstemious regime, when I believe he would make a complete return to his previous exceptionally high state of physical fitness.'"</p> <p>M reached over and slid the report into his OUT tray. He put his hands flat down on the desk in front of him and looked sternly across at Bond. He said, 'Not very satisfactory is it, James?'</p> <p>Bond tried to keep impatience out of his voice. He said, 'I'm perfectly fit, sir. Everyone has occasional headaches. Most weekend golfers have fibrositis. You get it from sweating and then sitting in a draught. Aspirin and embrocation get rid of them. Nothing to it really, sir.'</p> <p>M said severely, 'That's just where you're making a big mistake, James. Taking medicine only suppresses these symptoms of yours. Medicine doesn't get to the root of the trouble. It only conceals it. The result is a more highly poisoned condition, which may become chronic disease. All drugs are harmful to the system. They are contrary to nature. The same applies to most of the food we eat - white bread with all the roughage removed, refined sugar with all the goodness machined out of it, pasteurised milk which has had most of the vitamins boiled away, everything overcooked and denaturized. Why,' M reached into his pocket for his notebook and consulted it, 'do you know what our bread contains apart from a bit of over-ground flour?' M looked accusingly at Bond, 'It contains large quantities of chalk, also benzol peroxide powder, chlorine gas, sal ammoniac, and alum.' M put the notebook back in his pocket. 'What do you think of that?'</p> <p>Bond, mystified by all this, said defensively, 'I don't eat all that much bread, sir.'</p> <p>'Maybe not,' said M impatiently. 'But how much stone-ground whole wheat do you eat? How much yoghurt? Uncooked vegetables, nuts, fresh fruit?'</p> <p>Bond smiled. 'Practically none at all, sir.'</p> <p>'It's no laughing matter.' M tapped his forefinger on the desk for emphasis. 'Mark my words. There is no way to health except the natural way. All your troubles' - Bond opened his mouth to protest, but M held up his hand - 'the deep-seated toxaemia revealed by your Medical, are the result of a basically unnatural way of life. Ever heard of Bircher-Brenner, for instance? Or Kneipp, Preissnitz, Rikli, Schroth, Gossmann, Bilz?'</p> <p>'No, sir.'</p> <p>'Just so. Well those are the men you would be wise to study. Those are the great naturopaths - the men whose teaching we have foolishly ignored. Fortunately,' M's eyes gleamed enthusiastically, 'there are a number of disciples of these men practising in England. Nature cure is not beyond our reach.'</p> <p>James Bond looked curiously at M. What the hell had got into the old man? Was all this the first sign of senile decay? But M looked fitter than Bond had ever seen him. The cold grey eyes were clear as crystal and the skin of the hard, lined face was luminous with health. Even the iron-grey hair seemed to have new life. Then what was all this lunacy?</p> <p>M reached for his IN tray and placed it in front of him in a preliminary gesture of dismissal. He said cheerfully, 'Well, that's all, James. Miss Moneypenny has made the reservation. Two weeks will be quite enough to put you right. You won't know yourself when you come out. New man.'</p> <p>Bond looked across at M, aghast. He said in a strangled voice, 'Out of where, sir?' 'Place called "Shrublands". Run by quite a famous man in his line - Wain, Joshua Wain. Remarkable chap. Sixty-five. Doesn't look a day over forty. He'll take good care of you. Very up-to-date equipment, and he's even got his own herb garden. Nice stretch of country. Near Washington in Sussex. And don't worry about your work here. Put it right out of your mind for a couple of weeks. I'll tell 009 to take care of the Section.'</p> <p>Bond couldn't believe his ears. He said, 'But, sir. I mean, I'm perfectly all right. Are you sure? I mean, is this really necessary?'</p> <p>'No,' M smiled frostily. 'Not necessary. Essential. If you want to stay in the double-0 Section, that is. I can't afford to have an officer in that section who isn't one hundred per cent fit.' M lowered his eyes to the basket in front of him and took out a signal file. 'That's all, 007.' He didn't look up. The tone of voice was final.</p> <p>Bond got to his feet. He said nothing. He walked across the room and let himself out, closing the door with exaggerated softness.</p> <p>Outside the door, Miss Moneypenny looked sweetly up at him.</p> <p>Bond walked over to her desk and banged his fist down so that the typewriter jumped. He said furiously, 'Now what the hell. Penny? Has the old man gone off his rocker? What's all this bloody nonsense? I'm damned if I'm going. He's absolutely nuts.'</p> <p>Miss Moneypenny smiled happily. 'The manager's been terribly helpful and kind. He says he can give you the Myrtle room, in the Annex. He says it's a lovely room. It looks right over the herb garden. They've got their own herb garden, you know.'</p> <p>'I know all about their bloody herb garden. Now look here, Penny,' Bond pleaded with her, 'be a good girl and tell me what it's all a...</p></p><h2>100 Great Children&#39;s Picturebooks</h2><p>This unashamed visual feast celebrates the best designed and illustrated picturebooks from around the world over the past one hundred years.<br><br>Each book is a creation of genius and inventiveness, and their design and illustration represent such diverse trends as the Russian Constructivists, Italian Futurists, and Postwar Neo-romantics.

Dawn, and Mary-Marie.</p><h2>The Birth of Black America: The First African Americans and the Pursuit of Freedom at Jamestown</h2><p>The voyage that shaped early America was neither that of the Susan Constant in 1607 nor the Mayflower in 1620. Absolutely vital to the formation of English-speaking America was the voyage made by some sixty Africans stolen from a Spanish slave ship and brought to the young struggling colony of Jamestown in 1619. It was an act of colonial piracy that angered King James I of England, causing him to carve up the Virginia Company&#39;s monopoly for virtually all of North America. It was an infusion of brave and competent souls who were essential to Jamestown&#39;s survival and success. And it was the arrival of pioneers who would fire the first salvos in the centuries-long African-American battle for liberation. Until now, it has been buried by historians. Four hundred years after the birth of English-speaking America, as a nation turns its attention to its ancestry, The Birth of Black America reconstructs the true origins of the United States and of the African-American experience.</p><p>Tim Hashaw is an investigative reporter who has been recognized as an outstanding journalist by Tom Brokaw and the prestigious National Radio-Television News Directors Association (RTNDA), the National Headliners Club, the Associated Press and United Press International and the Francis C. Moore journalism award. He is also the author of CHILDREN OF PERDITION: MELUNGEONS AND THE STRUGGLE OF MIXED AMERICA. A descendant of the Melungeons&#x2014;an obscure, mysterious people exclusive to America who are of mixed European, Native American and African ancestry and who are linked to the first generation of Africans at Jamestown&#x2014;Hashaw's ancestors include two of the first Jamestown African families, the Gowens and the Johnsons. He lives in Houston, Texas.Hashaw (<i>Children of Perdition: Melungeons and the Struggle for Mixed America</i>) offers a welcome variation on early America and the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. Historians have long known that Africans first appeared in the Virginia record in 1619. Hashaw traces those first black Virginians back to Portuguese Angola: they were captives on a Spanish slave ship, which was attacked by two pirate vessels that eventually transported 60 or so Africans to Virginia and Bermuda. Hashaw recreates the lives some of these early African Virginians made for themselves: Benjamin Doll purchased six indentured English servants, became a plantation owner, learned to read and write, and was appointed by a white widow to serve as her attorney. Another eventually purchased African slaves. Perhaps straining to find a partially happy ending to the tragic first scene in the history of American racial slavery, Hashaw notes that Angolan Virginians participated in Bacon's Rebellion, and he suggests that the 1676 revolt was the first expression of a fighting spirit that culminated in abolition. Hashaw offers both an exciting story of crime on the high seas and a fascinating social history of 17th-century black America.

The boy is mauled by Apron, the neighbor's ailing cow whom he helps, alone, to give birth. The grateful farmer brings him a gift -- a newborn pig. His father at first demurs ("We thank you, Brother Tanner," said Papa, "but it's not the Shaker Way to take frills for being neighborly. All that Robert done was what any farmer would do for another") but is persuaded. Rob keeps the pig, names her, and gives her his devotion ... He wrestles with grammar in the schoolhouse. He hears rumors of sin. He is taken -- at last -- to the Rutland Fair. He broadens his heart to make room even for Baptists. And when his father, who can neither read nor cipher, whose hands are bloodied by his trade, whose wisdom and mastery of country things are bred in the bone, entrusts Rob with his final secret, the boy makes the sacrifice that completes his passage into manhood.<br><br>All is told with quiet humor and simplicity. Here are lives lived by earthy reason -- in a novel that, like a hoedown country fiddler's tune, rings at the same time with both poignancy and cheer.</p><p>Robert Newton Peck comes from generations of Yankee farmers. Like the Vermont folk he writes about in his novel, he was raised as a boy in the Shaker Way, which endured even after the sect itself had died out. Its view of life is embodied in the character of his young protagonist&#39;s father, who believed that a faith is more blessed when put to use than when put to word: &#34;A man&#39;s worship counts for naught, unless his dog and cat are the better for it.&#34;I should have been in school that April day.<br> But instead I was up on the ridge near the old spar mine above our farm, whipping the gray trunk of a rock maple with a dead stick, and hating Edward Thatcher. During recess, he&#x2019;d pointed at my clothes and made sport of them. Instead of tying into him, I&#x2019;d turned tail and run off. And when Miss Malcom rang the bell to call us back inside, I was halfway home.<br> Picking up a stone, I threw it into some bracken ferns, hard as I could. Someday that was how hard I was going to light into Edward Thatcher, and make him bleed like a stuck pig. I&#x2019;d kick him from one end of Vermont to the other, and sorry him good. I&#x2019;d teach him not to make fun of Shaker ways. He&#x2019;d never show his face in the town of Learning, ever again. No, sir.<br> A painful noise made me whip my head around and jump at the same time. When I saw her, I knew she was in bad trouble.<br> It was the big Holstein cow, one of many, that belonged to our near neighbor, Mr. Tanner. This one he called &#x201c;Apron&#x201d; because she was mostly black, except for the white along her belly which went up her front and around her neck like a big clean apron. She was the biggest cow, Mr. Tanner told Papa, and his best milker. And he was fixing up to take her to Rutland Fair, come summer.<br> As I ran toward her, she made her dreadful noise again. I got close up and saw why. Her big body was pumping up and down, trying to have her calf. She&#x2019;d fell down and there was blood on her foreleg, and her mouth was all thick and foamy with yellow-green spit. I tried to reach my hand out and pat her head; but she was wild-eyed mean, and making this breezy noise almost every breath.<br> Turning away from me, she showed me her swollen rump. Her tail was up and arched high, whipping through the air with every heave of her back. Sticking out of her was the head and one hoof of her calf. His head was so covered with blood and birth sop that I had no way of telling he was alive or dead. Until I heard him bawl.<br> Apron went crashing through the puckerbush, me right behind. I&#x2019;d never caught up. But because she had to stop and strain, I got to the calf&#x2019;s head and got a purchase on him.<br> He was so covered with slime, and Apron was so wandering, there was no holding to it. Besides, being just twelve years old, I weighed a bit over a hundred pounds. Apron was comfortable over a thousand, and it wasn&#x2019;t much of a tug for her. As I went down, losing my grip on the calf&#x2019;s neck, her hoof caught my shinbone and it really smarted. The only thing that made me get up and give the whole idea another go was when he bawled again.<br> I&#x2019;d just wound up running away from Edward Thatcher and running away from the schoolhouse. I was feathered if I was going to run away from one darn more thing.<br> I needed a rope. But there wasn&#x2019;t any, so I had to make one. It didn&#x2019;t have to be long, just strong.<br> Chasing old Apron through the next patch of prickers sure took some fun out of the whole business. I made my mistake of trying to take my trousers off as I ran. No good. So I sat down in the prickers, yanked &#x2018;em off over my boots, and caught up to Apron. After a few bad tries, I got one pantleg around her calf&#x2019;s head and knotted it snug.<br> &#x201c;Calf,&#x201d; I said to him, &#x201c;you stay up to your ma&#x2019;s hindside and you&#x2019;re about to choke. So you might as well choke getting yourself born.&#x201d;<br> Whatever old Apron decided that I was doing to her back yonder, she didn&#x2019;t take kindly to it. So she started off again with me in the rear, hanging on to wait Christmas, and my own bare butt and privates catching a thorn with every step. And that calf never coming one inch closer to coming out. But when Apron stopped to heave again I got the other pantleg around a dogwood tree that was about thick as a fencepost.<br> Now only three things could happen: My trousers would rip. Apron would just uproot the tree. The calf would slide out.<br> But nothing happened. Apron just stood shaking and heaving and straining and never moved forward a step. I got the other pantleg knotted about the dogwood; and like Apron, I didn&#x2019;t know what to do next.<br> Her calf bawled once more, making a weaker noise than before. But all Apron did was<br>heave in that one place.<br> &#x201c;You old bitch,&#x201d; I yelled at her, grabbing a dead blackberry cane that was as long as a bullwhip and big around as a broom handle, &#x201c;you move that big black smelly ass, you hear?&#x201d;<br> I never hit anybody, boy or beast, as I hit that cow. I beat her so hard I was crying. Where I held the big cane, the thorns were chewing up my hands real bad. But it only got me madder. <br> I kicked her. And stoned her. I kicked her again one last time, so hard in the udder that I thought I heard her grunt. Both her hind quarters sort of hunkered down in the brush. Then she started forward, my trousers went tight, I heard a rip and a calf bawl. And a big hunk of hot stinking stuff went all over me. Some of it was calf, some of it wasn&#x2019;t. <br> As I went down under the force and weight of it, I figured something either got dead or got born.<br> All I knew was that I was snarled up in a passel of wet stuff, and there was a strong cord holding me against something that was very hot and kicked a lot. I brushed some of the slop away from my eyes and looked up. And there was Apron, her big black head and her big black mouth licking first me and her calf.<br> But she was far from whole. Her mouth was open and she was grasping for air. She stumbled once. I thought for sure I was going to wind up being under a very big cow. The noise in her throat came at me again, and her tongue lashed to and fro like a tail of a clock. It looked to me as if there was something in her mouth. She would start to breathe and then, like a cork in a bottle, some darn thing in there would cut it off.<br> Her big body swayed like she was dizzy or sick. As the front of her fell to her knees, her head hit my chest as I lay on the ground, her nose almost touching my chin. She had stopped breathing!<br> Her jaw was locked open so I put my hand in her mouth, but felt only her swollen tongue. I stretched my fingers up into her throat- and there it was! A hard ball, about apple-size. It was stuck in her windpipe, or her gullet. I didn&#x2019;t know which and didn&#x2019;t care. So I shut my eyes, grabbed it, and yanked.<br> Somebody told me once that a cow won&#x2019;t bite. That somebody is as wrong as sin on Sunday. I thought my arm had got sawed off part way between elbow and shoulder. She bit and bit and never let go. She got to her feet and kept on biting. <br>That devil cow ran down off that ridge with my arm in her mouth, and dragging me half-naked with her. What she didn&#x2019;t do to me with her teeth, she did with her front hoofs.<br> It should have been broad daylight, but it was night. Black night.

Sayers first published by Victor Gollancz in 1939. The book&#39;s title is taken from the first story in the collection. Lord Peter Wimsey stories: In the Teeth of the Evidence; Absolutely Elsewhere. Montague Egg stories:A Shot at Goal; Dirt Cheap; Bitter Almonds; False Weight; The Professor&#39;s Manuscript. Other stories: The Milk-Bottles; Dilemma; An Arrow O&#39;er the House; Scrawns; Nebuchadnezzar; The Inspiration of Mr. Budd; Blood Sacrifice; Suspicion; The Leopard Lady; The Cyprian Cat.</p><p><p>Dorothy L. Sayers was born in 1893. She was one of the first women to be awarded a degree by Oxford University, and later she became a copywriter at an ad agency. In 1923 she published her first novel featuring the aristocratic detective Lord Peter Wimsey, who became one of the world's most popular fictional heroes. She died in 1957.</p>Ian Carmichael is a great reader; his sound effects, especially of the dentist&#39;s drill, are unforgettable and add a unique element to this collection of seventeen stories. Carmichael is perfect as Lord Peter Wimsey, whom he played on TV, and he performs Montague Egg and the other multitude of characters with rich, successful accents and dialects. He presents the narration consistently and clearly with excellent dramatic pacing. &#34;The Leopard Lady,&#34; in which Cyril is so delicately disposed of, and &#34;The Cyprian Cat,&#34; in which Mrs. Merridew dies after the Cyprian cat is shot, are excellent examples of Sayers at her best. These classic British detective stories, with a little of the supernatural thrown in, will delight listeners. S.C.A.

From food history to cooking terms, cocktail recipes to dining etiquette, grace before meals to after-dinner toasts-this olla podrida offers everything for the wine drinker, gastronome, and glutton. And Ben Schott's brilliant juxtaposition of delectable tidbits makes this new miscellany so hard to put down, it may even make you late for dinner. <br>Ben Schott is a photographer, designer, and Miscellanist. He lives in Highgate, London. <br>Also available: <i>Schott's Original Miscellany </i>hc 1-58234-349-7 $14.95 <br>Praise for <i>Schott's Original Miscellany</i>: "It's the ultimate book for browsing...as hilarious as it is addictive."-<i>Newsweek</i> "Ben Schott's utterly indispensable Schott's Original Miscellany is...scarily habit-forming, so caveat emptor!"-<i>Vanity Fair </i>"It is so pleasant just to have this book near."-<i>Los Angeles Times </i>"If nothing else, bathroom reading just got a lot smarter."-<i>Daily Candy </i>"Somehow Mr. Schott turns a collection of trivia into a window on the world that is hilarious, puzzling, and inspiring."- <i>Wall Street Journal</i> "An irresistible, irreplaceable, inexhaustible delight."-<i>Baltimore Sun </i>"Schott's Original Miscellany is a charmingly addictive curiosity cabinet...the first really great bathroom book of the 21st century."-<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p></p><p><p><b>Ben Schott</b> is a photographer, designer, and miscellanist. He lives in Highgate, London.</p>By now, readers may have finally gotten around to reading every last drop of trivia in last year's oddball bestseller (here and in the U.K.), <i>Schott's Original Miscellany</i>. Just in time, the London "miscellanist" returns, bestowing upon hungry readers every random thing they've ever wondered about the culinary arts and then some. It's just as addictive and enlightening as the first book, as Schott uses his signature objectivity to relay such obscure facts as "The Romans developed a taste for the edible dormouse <i>(Myoxus glis)</i>, which they fattened in special cages <i>(gliraria)</i> before stuffing and roasting." Servants' wages, rates of digestion, blessings for wine and bread, dining times for monks, cognac nomenclature, Laotian cooking measures, ways to ask for the bill in 22 languages, microbial count in raw meat, Latin names for herbs&#x2014;Schott addresses all these subjects and more, hopping between completely useless (though always fascinating) information and eminently practical tidbits. The "Some slang for drunkenness" entry (which lists, among other terms, "got a crumb in his beard," "wankered" and "sniffed the barmaid's apron") makes the book a wise choice for placement on the coffee table, while the "Measuring spaghetti" diagram suggests it is an indispensable kitchen reference. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Whether as a young journalist investigating city corruption, a campaign consultant guiding underdog candidates against entrenched orthodoxy, or as senior adviser to the president during one of the worst crises in American history, Axelrod held fast to his faith in the power of stories to unite diverse communities and ignite transformative political change. Now this legendary strategist, the mastermind behind Barack Obama&#x2019;s historic election campaigns, shares a wealth of stories from his forty-year journey through the inner workings of American democracy. <i>Believer</i> is the tale of a political life well lived, of a man who never gave up on the deepest promises our country has to offer.<br><br><i>Believer</i> reveals the roots of Axelrod&#x2019;s devotion to politics and his faith in democratic change. As a child of the &#x2019;60s in New York City, Axelrod worked his first campaigns during a tumultuous decade that began with soaring optimism and ended in violence and chaos. As a young newspaperman in Chicago during the 1970s and &#x2019;80s, Axelrod witnessed another world transformed when he reported on the dissolution of the last of the big city political machines&#x2014;Richard Daley, Dan Rostenkowski, and Harold Washington&#x2014;along with the emergence of a dynamic black independent movement that ultimately made Obama&#x2019;s ascent possible.<br><br>After cutting his teeth in the rollicking world of Chicago journalism, Axelrod switched careers to become a political strategist. His unorthodox tactics during his first campaign helped him get Paul Simon unexpectedly elected to the Senate, and soon Axelrod&#x2019;s counsel was sought by the greatest lights of the Democratic Party. Working for path breakers like Hillary Clinton, Deval Patrick, and Rahm Emanuel&#x2014;and morally conflicted characters like Rod Blagojevich and John Edwards&#x2014;Axelrod, for better and worse, redefined the techniques by which modern political campaigns are run.<br><br>The heart of <i>Believer</i> is Axelrod&#x2019;s twenty-year friendship with Barack Obama, a warm partnership that inspired both men even as it propelled each to great heights. Taking a chance on an unlikely candidate for the U.S. Senate, Axelrod ultimately collaborated closely with Obama on his political campaigns, and served as the invaluable strategist who contributed to the tremendous victories of 2008 and 2012. Switching careers again, Axelrod served as senior adviser to the president during one of the most challenging periods in national history: working at Obama&#x2019;s side as he battled an economic disaster; navigated America through two wars; and fought to reform health care, the financial sector, and our gridlocked political institutions. In <i>Believer</i>, Axelrod offers a deeper and richer profile of this extraordinary figure&#x2014;who in just four years vaulted from the Illinois State Senate to the Oval Office&#x2014;from the perspective of one who was at his side every step of the way.<br><br>Spanning forty years that include corruption and transformation, turmoil and progress, <i>Believer</i> takes readers behind the closed doors of politics even as it offers a thrilling call to democratic action. Axelrod&#x2019;s <i>Believer</i> is a powerful and inspiring memoir enlivened by the charm and candor of one of the greatest political strategists in recent American history.</p><p><b>DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, author of&nbsp;<i>The Bully Pulpit&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Team of Rivals</i></b><br><b>&#x201c;Beautifully written with warmth, humor, and remarkable self-awareness,&nbsp;<i>Believer&nbsp;</i>is one of the finest political memoirs I have ever read.&#x201d;</b></p></p><p>DAVID AXELROD spent eight years as a reporter and columnist for the Chicago Tribune. As a political consultant, Axelrod has managed strategy for more than 150 local, state, and national campaigns. Axelrod most recently served as senior strategist to President Obama&#x2019;s successful reelection campaign. He served in that same role in then-Senator Obama&#x2019;s 2008 presidential campaign, before going on to serve in the White House as senior adviser to the president. After the 2012 campaign, Axelrod founded the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago.Not everyone can point to a moment, the exact time and place, when&nbsp;a lifelong passion began. I can.<br><br>It was 1960, twelve days before the presidential election. John F. Kennedy,&nbsp;locked in a dead even race with Richard Nixon, was barnstorming the neighborhoods&nbsp;of New York City. And on the afternoon of October 27, he came&nbsp;to mine.<br><br>Stuyvesant Town, a forest of redbrick high-rises on Manhattan&#x2019;s Lower East&nbsp;Side, was built after World War II to house the flood of returning GIs and&nbsp;their families. Now, in the final, frantic days of his campaign, Kennedy had&nbsp;come there to summon a new generation of leadership.<br><br>I was, no doubt, a little newer than he had in mind. I was five.<br>An inspiring woman named Jessie Berry, who all but raised me while my&nbsp;mother was at work, took me to see JFK that day. Jessie, an African American,&nbsp;had come to New York from South Carolina as a young woman during the&nbsp;Great Migration. She had spent her days taking care of other people&#x2019;s kids,&nbsp;scraping together what she could to help support her own two daughters. Yet&nbsp;she was determined that the future be better, if not for her, then for her children&nbsp;and her grandchildren.<br><br>Maybe that&#x2019;s why she took me to see this promising young leader, a Catholic,&nbsp;whose election would break down a historic barrier. Maybe she saw in him&nbsp;hope for the future. (Looking back, I see that she might also have viewed the&nbsp;outing as a way to occupy her maddeningly hyperactive little charge.)<br><br>So when Jessie heard that Kennedy was coming to Stuyvesant Town, and&nbsp;would be just two blocks from my family&#x2019;s apartment at 622 East Twentieth&nbsp;Street, she took me by the hand and we headed to the rally. There, she sat me&nbsp;on top of a mailbox to give me a better view. From that perch, I watched in&nbsp;awe as Twentieth Street (at that section, a wide boulevard) filled up with people &nbsp;instead of the usual, ceaseless parade of cars. Near the front of the crowd, close&nbsp;enough to shake hands with the candidate, I spotted my sister, Joan, and her&nbsp;friends heading home from the junior high across First Avenue.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t the only young kid in the crowd. Stuyvesant Town and the adjoining&nbsp;Peter Cooper Village were built and designed for young families, with a&nbsp;network of playgrounds on greened, tree-lined campuses. So when JFK came,&nbsp;many mothers turned out, babies in tow, eager to catch a glimpse of the dashing&nbsp;young senator. It was, as the advance people who plan such rallies say, a&nbsp;built-in audience.<br><br>They listened in rapt attention as he delivered his call to action.<br>It was just fifteen years after the end of World War II. Every adult there had&nbsp;endured that ordeal and, before it, the Great Depression. Now a Cold War&nbsp;hovered over their everyday lives, carrying with it the threat of nuclear annihilation.&nbsp;They had played a role in saving the nation, and were accustomed to&nbsp;sacrifice, not the pain-free succor that would become the coin of the realm of&nbsp;future political campaigns.<br><br>So Kennedy, himself a war hero, didn&#x2019;t come bearing lavish promises. In a&nbsp;harbinger of the inaugural address he would deliver three months later, he&nbsp;came with a challenge.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t run on the presidential program of saying that if I am elected, life&nbsp;will be easy,&#x201d; Kennedy declared, his voice booming off the surrounding highrise&nbsp;buildings. &#x201c;I think to be a citizen of the United States in the 1960s is a&nbsp;hazardous occupation. But it is also one that offers challenge and hope, and I&nbsp;believe the choice lies with you on November 8.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whether I am the candidate for the presidency, or president, or stay in the&nbsp;Senate, I regard our obligation not to please you but to serve you, and in my&nbsp;judgment, in 1960, a candidate for the presidency should be willing to give the&nbsp;truth to the people, and the truth is that what we are now doing is not good&nbsp;enough.&#x201d;<br><br>I was too young to understand the full meaning of his speech or the magnitude&nbsp;of the moment. I recovered his words only years later, from one of those&nbsp;online archives no one back then could have imagined. I might not have understood&nbsp;exactly why the crowd cheered when it did, or that Kennedy was desperately&nbsp;seeking votes, locked in what would be one of the closest presidential&nbsp;contests ever. Yet to this five-year-old, the scene was pure magic, electric and&nbsp;important. Though I couldn&#x2019;t grasp the nuances, I somehow absorbed the&nbsp;larger message: we are the masters of our future, and politics is the means by&nbsp;which we shape it. From that moment on, I was hooked. I wanted to be a part&nbsp;of the action.<br><br>Fifty-two years later, on November 5, 2012, I stood at the foot of the stage&nbsp;at another huge, outdoor rally, on the eve of another presidential election. It&nbsp;was 10:00 p.m. in Des Moines. A crowd of twenty thousand stretched from the&nbsp;podium on Locust Street four blocks east toward the glistening gold dome of&nbsp;the Iowa state capitol. They waited for hours, on that chilly November night, to&nbsp;watch President Barack Obama deliver the final speech at the final campaign&nbsp;stop of his political career&#x2014;and mine.<br><br>For Team Obama, it was a homecoming. Four years earlier, Iowans had&nbsp;breathed life into his audacious candidacy for president. Obama had virtually&nbsp;taken up residence there, spending eighty-nine days in the state during the runup&nbsp;to Iowa&#x2019;s critical, first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses, as he made his&nbsp;case for change. Along the way, he developed strong bonds with the folks he&nbsp;met in countless living rooms, diners, and union halls across the state.<br><br>While the pundits and political insiders in Washington were smugly writing&nbsp;him off as a political shooting star, Obama placed his bet on Iowa and the&nbsp;army of idealistic young people who descended upon the state, hell-bent on&nbsp;changing the course of history. And without Iowa&#x2019;s embrace, his candidacy&nbsp;almost certainly would have died a quick, snowy death.&nbsp;<br><br>Iowa was the beginning of everything. Now, steeled by a thousand battles,&nbsp;Obama had returned there to plead his case, seeking the chance to finish what&nbsp;he had started. He had taken bold and controversial steps to revive a wounded&nbsp;economy, but the work of redeeming an embattled middle class was far from&nbsp;done. He had ended our war in Iraq and, having brought Osama bin Laden&nbsp;and many of Al Qaeda&#x2019;s leaders to justice, was on the path to ending another&nbsp;war in Afghanistan. Yet it would take a continued commitment to bring those&nbsp;troops home, and the world would only become more complex and challenging.&nbsp;After a lengthy and bruising fight to pass historic health care reform, it&nbsp;would take his next term to implement and undergird it against continuing&nbsp;opposition efforts at subversion and repeal. He felt an urgency to deal with the&nbsp;great, unresolved problems of climate change and immigration reform. And&nbsp;maybe, just maybe, a second, resounding victory would pave the way for more&nbsp;comity and cooperation in Washington, which was the great, unfulfilled promise&nbsp;of his presidency.<br><br>A year earlier, following a devastating standoff with Congress over the&nbsp;nation&#x2019;s debt limit, Obama&#x2019;s standing with the public had hit a new low. Some&nbsp;polls showed his approval ratings sinking perilously below 40 percent. Trial&nbsp;heats with Mitt Romney, the likely Republican nominee, showed the president&nbsp;running well below the majority he would need to win. Nate Silver, the whiz&nbsp;kid political handicapper who later would win plaudits for accurately calling&nbsp;the outcome of the election, had written a provocative and, for our team, thoroughly&nbsp;depressing magazine piece for the New York Times with a pointed headline:&nbsp;&#x201c;Is Obama Toast?&#x201d;<br><br>And while Obama remained publicly defiant back then, he was privately&nbsp;resigned to the prospect of defeat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m realistic about this. We have an uphill&nbsp;fight,&#x201d; he said, during one of our conversations in the dark days of 2011.&nbsp;&#x201c;Michelle and I have talked about it&#x2014;about where we would live if we lose.&nbsp;The girls are settled here now, so we really need to think about that.&#x201d;<br><br>But whatever doubts Obama harbored were matched by a preternatural&nbsp;sense of competitiveness. This man hated to lose a game of H-O-R-S-E, much&nbsp;less an election that would define his presidency. So he fought his way back,&nbsp;knowing what defeat would mean for his programs, his legacy, and for the millions&nbsp;of young black Americans for whom his election had opened new vistas.&nbsp;And he believed the stakes for the country were large.&nbsp;Now, seven hours before the first polling places opened out east, he stood&nbsp;inside a security tent in Des Moines, waiting to be introduced to the rapturous&nbsp;crowd and shuffling from foot to foot like an athlete champing at the bit to get&nbsp;into the game. Michelle Obama, who had been crisscrossing the nation on her&nbsp;own, had joined up with her husband for the final stop and was making the&nbsp;introductory remarks onstage.<br><br>It had been remarkable to watch Michelle&#x2019;s evolution, from reluctant conscript&nbsp;in 2007 to a buoyant and beloved campaigner five years later.&nbsp;Thrown out on the campaign trail without adequate staffing or preparation&nbsp;in 2007, she quickly became fodder for the right-wing noise machine, which&nbsp;seized on every opportunity to cast her as the angry, militant black woman&nbsp;behind the affable candidate. Michelle, an accomplished lawyer who had given&nbsp;up her career to make her husband&#x2019;s dream possible, never expected to become&nbsp;fodder for his opposition. She was stung by the nasty characterizations and skittish&nbsp;about putting herself out there for more abuse.<br><br>But over the years, she had made peace, if sometimes an uneasy one, with&nbsp;her role as a public figure, using her platform to promote child nutrition and&nbsp;fitness, the welfare of military families, and other vital causes about which she&nbsp;felt deeply. She had become an extraordinarily evocative speaker as well as a&nbsp;charming and witty guest on late-night talk shows. Still, if the First Lady was&nbsp;willing to put herself out there, she was adamant that her splendid daughters,&nbsp;Malia and Sasha, be shielded from the public stage.<br><br>Whenever there was a potential scheduling conflict between her public role&nbsp;and her parental obligations, everyone in the White House knew which priority&nbsp;would win. Anyone brave (or dumb) enough to question that rule invariably&nbsp;emerged with scorched ears.<br><br>Buoyed by a deep and abiding belief in her husband, Michelle had become&nbsp;his most effective surrogate and, privately, his fiercest defender. Though she&nbsp;had little direct contact with the White House staff, word would spread quickly&nbsp;if Michelle felt the president had been let down. She could be tough, even on&nbsp;his supporters, sharing her frustration over the frequent friendly fire from the&nbsp;Left that always seems unhappy with any compromise. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of all the&nbsp;complaining,&#x201d; she told a small fund-raising luncheon in New York City a few&nbsp;weeks before the election, upbraiding a group of women who had paid twenty&nbsp;thousand dollars a plate for the privilege. &#x201c;My husband has worked his heart&nbsp;out to get a lot of things done for this country, up against a bunch of folks on&nbsp;the other side who will do anything to get in the way. So just stop it! He needs&nbsp;your help, not your complaints!&#x201d;<br><br>But now the election was just hours away, and Michelle warmed up the Des&nbsp;Moines crowd with one last impassioned plea for support.<br><br>&#x201c;While we have come so far, we know that there is so much more to do.&nbsp;And what we really, truly know is that we cannot turn back now. We need&nbsp;to keep moving this country forward,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;So that means that we need to&nbsp;re-elect the man who has been fighting for us every single day&#x2014;my husband,&nbsp;the love of my life, the President of the United States . . . Barack Obama!&#x201d;<br><br>On cue, Obama burst out of the tent and sprinted up a set of stairs onto the&nbsp;makeshift stage and into a warm embrace with his wife.<br><br>We tend to idealize political families, but the Obamas deserve any admiration&nbsp;they get. As they stood there together and waved to the crowd, at this last&nbsp;rally of their last campaign, they both understood the many sacrifices that&nbsp;Michelle and the family had endured to make Obama&#x2019;s career possible.<br><br>For twelve years as a state legislator, U.S. senator, and presidential candidate,&nbsp;Obama had spent much of his time away from home. Though he was a&nbsp;doting father who pined for his kids when he was on the road, most of the&nbsp;responsibility for raising them fell to Michelle. Their years in the White House,&nbsp;living above his office, were the first in which Barack could regularly and&nbsp;reliably share dinner with the family and spend time with his girls. Yet the&nbsp;presidency also placed extraordinary constraints on their lives.<br><br>Maybe it was that knowledge, or Michelle&#x2019;s proud words, or the sight of so&nbsp;many old Iowa friends at the end of this long gauntlet, but the normally unflappable&nbsp;president was quickly moved to tears.<br><br>&#x201c;Right behind these bleachers is the building that was home to our Iowa&nbsp;headquarters in 2008,&#x201d; he said, pointing to a rambling storefront that was, five&nbsp;years earlier, our littered, frenzied nerve center. (Today it&#x2019;s the pristine headquarters&nbsp;of a New Age church.)<br><br>&#x201c;This was where some of the first young people who joined our campaign&nbsp;set up shop, willing to work for little pay and less sleep because they believed&nbsp;that people who love their country can change it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And when the cynics said we couldn&#x2019;t, you said &#x2018;Yes, we can!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>The crowd picked up the chant. &#x201c;Yes, we can!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You said, &#x2018;Yes, we can!&#x2019;&#x2014;and we did. Against all odds, we did! We&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t know what challenges would come when we began this journey.&nbsp;We didn&#x2019;t know how deep the crisis would turn out. But we knew we would&nbsp;get through those challenges the same way this nation always has&#x2014;with that&nbsp;determined, unconquerable American spirit that says no matter how bad the<br>storm gets, no matter how tough times are, we&#x2019;re all in this together. We rise or&nbsp;fall as one nation and as one people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes We Can.&#x201d; It was the tag line I had written for the first TV ad of our&nbsp;first, long-shot campaign together just eight years earlier, when Obama, a&nbsp;largely unknown and seriously underfunded state legislator, set out to win&nbsp;a seat in the U.S. Senate. And it became our mantra when, in 2007, he enlisted&nbsp;millions of Americans to the cause of change.<br><br>As Obama spoke almost wistfully about those heady, hopeful days of 2008,&nbsp;they seemed like a distant dream.

Where the breakers crash and the salt water whirls, that is where the place that is ours rises from the sea. The legacy that passes from father to son.&nbsp;<br>LENNART ALBINSSON--Rï¿½DMANSï¿½<b>The sea has given and the sea has taken away</b>Who flies there in the feather-harbour, who climbs up there out of the black, shining waters?&nbsp;<br>GUNNAR EKELï¿½F--TJï¿½RVEN<b>Sea buckthorn</b><i>Three thousand years ago, Domarï¿½ was nothing but a large, flat rock sticking up out of the water, crowned by an erratic boulder the ice had left behind. One nautical mile to the east it was possible to glimpse the round shape that would later rise out of the sea and be given the name Gï¿½vasten. Apart from that, there was nothing. It would be another thousand years before the surrounding islets and islands dared to poke their heads above the water, beginning the formation of the archipelago that goes under the name of Domarï¿½ archipelago today.</i><i>By that time the sea buckthorn had already arrived on Domarï¿½.</i><i>Down below the enormous block left by the ice, a shoreline had formed. There in the scree the sea buckthorn worked its way along with its creeping roots, the hardy shrub finding nourishment in the rotting seaweed, growing where there was nothing to grow in, clinging to the rocks. Sea buckthorn. Toughest of the tough.</i><i>And the sea buckthorn produced new roots, crept up over thewater's edge and grew on the slopes until a metallic-green border surrounded the uninhabited shores of Domarï¿½ like a fringe. Birds snatched the fiery yellow berries that tasted of bitter oranges and flew with them to other islands, spreading the gospel of the sea buckthorn to new shores, and within a few hundred years the green fringe could be seen in all directions.</i><i>But the sea buckthorn was preparing its own destruction.</i><i>The humus formed by its rotting leaves was richer than anything the stony shores could offer, and the alder saw its chance. It set its seeds in the mulch left by the sea buckthorn, and it grew stronger and stronger. The sea buckthorn was unable to tolerate either the nitrogen-rich soil produced by the alder, or the shade from its leaves, and it withdrew down towards the water.</i><i>With the alder came other plants that needed a higher level of nutrition, competing for the available space. The sea buckthorn was relegated to a shoreline that grew far too slowly, just half a metre in a hundred years. Despite the fact that it had given birth to the other plants, the sea buckthorn was displaced and set aside.</i><i>And so it sits there at the edge of the shore, biding its time. Beneath the slender, silky green leaves there are thorns. Big thorns.</i><b>Two small people and a large rock (July 1984)</b>They were holding hands.He was thirteen and she was twelve. If anyone in the gang caught sight of them, they would just die right there on the spot. They crept through the fir trees, alert to every sound and every movement as if they were on some secret mission. In a way they were: they were going to be together, but they didn't know that yet.It was almost ten o'clock at night, but there was still enough light in the sky for them to see each other's arms and legs as pale movements over the carpet of grass and earth still holding the warmthof the day. They didn't dare look at each other's faces. If they did, something would have to be said, and there were no words.They had decided to go up to the rock. A little way along the track between the fir trees their hands had brushed against each other's, and one of them had taken hold, and that was it. Now they were holding hands. If anything was said, something straightforward would become difficult.Anders' skin felt as if he had been out in the sun all day. It was hot and painful all over, and he felt dizzy, as if he had sunstroke; he was afraid of tripping over a root, afraid of his hand becoming sweaty, afraid that what he was doing was <i>out of order</i> in some way.There were couples in the gang. Martin and Malin were together now. Malin had gone out with Joel for a while. It was OK for them to lie there kissing when everybody could see them, and Martin said he and Malin had got as far as petting down by the boathouses. Whether or not it was true, it was OK for them to say--and do--that kind of thing. Partly because they were a year older, partly because they were good-looking. Cool. It gave them licence to do a lot of things, and to use a different language too. There was no point in trying to keep up, that would be embarrassing. You just had to sit there staring, trying to laugh in the right places. That's just how it was.Neither Anders nor Cecilia was a loser. They weren't outsiders like Henrik and Bjï¿½rn--Hubba and Bubba--but they weren't part of the clique that made the rules and decided which jokes were funny, either.For Anders and Cecilia to be walking along holding hands was utterly ridiculous. They knew this. Anders was short and borderline spindly, his brown hair too thin for him to give it any kind of style. He didn't understand how Martin and Joel did it. He'd tried slicking his hair back with gel once, but it looked weird and he'd rinsed it out before anyone saw it.There was something flat about Cecilia. Her body was angular and her shoulders were broad, despite the fact that she was slim. Virtually no hips or breasts. Her face looked small between thosebroad shoulders. She had medium-length fair hair and an unusually small nose dusted with freckles. When she put her hair up in a ponytail, Anders thought she looked really pretty. Her blue eyes always looked just a little bit sad, and Anders liked that. She looked as if she knew.Martin and Joel didn't know. Malin and Elin didn't know. They had the feeling, said the right things and were able to wear sandals without looking stupid. But they didn't know. They just did things. Sandra read books and was clever, but there was nothing in her eyes to indicate that she knew.Cecilia knew, and Anders could see that she knew, which proved that he knew as well. They recognised one another. He couldn't explain what it <i>was</i> that they knew, but it was something. Something about life, about how things really were.The terrain grew steeper, and as they made their way up towards the rock the trees thinned out. In a minute or two they would have to let go of one another's hands so they'd be able to climb.Anders stole a glance at Cecilia. She was wearing a yellow and white striped T-shirt with a wide neckline that revealed her collarbone. It was just unbelievable that she had been linked to him for what must be five minutes, that her skin had been touching his.<i>That she'd been his.</i>She had been his for five minutes. Soon they would let go, move apart and become ordinary people again. What would they say then?Anders looked down. The ground was starting to become stony, he had to watch where he was putting his feet. Every second he was expecting Cecilia to let go, but she didn't. He thought perhaps he was holding on so tightly that she <i>couldn't</i> let go. It was an embarrassing thought, so he loosened his grip slightly. Then she let go.He spent the two minutes it took to climb up the rock analysing whether he had, in fact, been holding her hand too tightly, or whether loosening his grip had made her think <i>he</i> was about to let go, and so she let go first.Regardless of what he knew or did not know, he was convincedthat Joel and Martin never had this kind of problem. He wiped his hand furtively on his trousers. It was slightly stiff and sweaty.When they reached the top of the rock, his head felt bigger than usual. The blood was humming in his ears and he was sure his face was bright red. He stared down at his chest where a little ghost looked out from a circle with a red line through it. <i>Ghostbusters</i>. It was his favourite top, and it had been washed so many times that the outline of the ghost was becoming blurred.'It's so beautiful.'Cecilia was standing at the edge of the rock looking out over the sea. They were up above the tops of the trees. Far below they could see the holiday village where almost all their friends lived. Out at sea the ferry to Finland was sailing along, a cluster of lights moving across the water. Further away and further out there were other archipelagos whose names Anders didn't know.He stood as close to her as he dared and said, 'I think it's the most beautiful thing in the world,' and regretted it as soon as the words were out of his mouth. It was a stupid thing to say, and he tried to improve matters by adding, 'That's one way of looking at it', but that wasn't right either. He moved away from her, following the edge of the rock.When he had walked all the way round, a distance of perhaps thirty metres, and was almost back with her, she said, 'It's odd, isn't it? This rock, I mean?'He had an answer to that. 'It's an erratic boulder. According to my dad, anyway.''What's that?'He gazed out across the sea, fixed his eyes on the Gï¿½vasten lighthouse and tried to remember what his father had told him. Anders made a sweeping movement with his arm, taking in the surrounding area. The old village, the mission, the alarm bell next to the shop.'Well...when there was ice. Covering everything here. The ice age. The ice picked up rocks. And when it melted, these rocks ended up all over the place.''So where did they come from? Originally?'His father had told him that as well, but he couldn't remember what he'd said. Where could the stones hav...</p><h2>See It and Sink It: Mastering Putting Through Peak Visual Peformance</h2><p>Dr. Craig L.

Set in southern Los Angeles (which makes for a terrifying sequence as blind Rachel and ailing Lars are trapped in their home without power during the 1992 Rodney King riots), backgrounds and props are lovingly detailed: these objects serve as memory triggers for Lars and Rachel, even as they eventually overwhelm them and their home, which the couple is loathe to leave. Rendered in thin, confident pen lines, Special Exits is laid out in an eight-panel grid, which creates a leisurely storytelling pace that not only helps to convey the slow, inexorable decline in Lars&#x2019; and Rachel&#x2019;s health, but perfectly captures the timbre of the exchanges between a long-married couple: the affectionate bickering; their gallows humor; their querulousness as their bodies break down. Though Lars and Rachel are the protagonists of Special Exits, Farmer makes her voice known through creative visual metaphors and in her indictment of the careless treatment of the elderly in nursing homes. <br></p><p>Joyce Farmer lives in Laguna Beach, CA.&#x201c;One of the best long-narrative comics I&#x2019;ve ever read, right up there with <em>Gen of Hiroshima</em> and <em>Maus</em>.

Throughout the last two thousand years, Christ has raised up patristic writers who have defended that original model. In modern times, however, this model is being pushed aside, the taste for genuine mystical expression is disappearing, and the initial Christian impetus is being disfigured. <p>That is why the works of St. Theophan the Recluse are so vital for today. He keeps the ancient patristic model sharp and clear, presenting it in modern language. He speaks to contemporary people who have been exposed to new realities, and thus renders inestimable help in linking them to the original Christian impetus and revealing to them the way into the Heavenly Kingdom. </p><p>The works of St. Theophan changed the spiritual face of Russia in the 19th century. With the publication of his greatest work, THE PATH TO SALVATION, the English-speaking world now has the opportunity to benefit likewise from this powerful inheritance to the people of the modern age. </p><p>Saint Theophan the Recluse is first and foremost a Church Father for modern times. Deeply aware of the roots of the modern age, he reinterprets ancient patristic wisdom in order to adapt it to the needs of the modern unchurched mind, which has been divorced from the Orthodox philosophy of life and even from the rudimentary principles of practical Christianity. </p><p>This classic textbook of spiritual life, now being offered in its entirety for the first time in English, seems to have been sent directly to today's readers by the great Russian recluse himself. Every line breathes his profound psychological understanding, his intricate experience in spiritual struggle, and above all his love, compassion and all-consuming desire that every person might be saved. Inspiring the reader with a sober longing for acquiring the Kingdom of Heaven, St. Theophan provides an infallible system for taking the Kingdom by force, in a Christian life of grace and repentance.</p></p><p>If the main goal of the repentant sinner should be total, light-bearing and blessed communion with God, then the main hindrance to this is the existence of the passions still active and working in him--the virtues being as yet unsealed in him--and the unrighteousness of his powers. Therefore his main work upon conversion and repentance should be the uprooting of passions and sealing the virtues--in a word, correcting himself. <p>In the kingdom of God there should not be anyone acting from himself; God should be acting in everything. This cannot happen as long as freedom stands for itself--it denies and turns away God's power. This stubborn resistance to God's power will only cease when our free, or self-acting, individual will and activity fall down before Him; when we pronounce the resolute prayer: "Do Thou, O Lord, do in me as Thou wilt, for I am blind and weak." </p><p>We must fulfill the commandments--all of them. But we do not naturally have the desire, fervor and zeal for this. This fire is kindled in our spirit by God's grace through repentance, for the sake of a contrite spirit and the promise to do God's will. This itself is the strength for keeping the commandments, and it alone is capable of keeping them all the time. If the fulfillment of the commandments is the foundation for salvation, then the spirit of zeal is our only saving power. Wherever it is present there is diligence, care, fervor, readiness, alacrity to do works pleasing to God. Where it is absent, everything ceases and falls away--there is no life of the spirit, and everything runs cold and dies. Though there may be good works, they will be only good in form, but not in power and spirit. This is that same fire that our Lord Jesus Christ came to kindle upon the earth, which lights the hearts of the faithful, through the Holy Spirit... </p><p>The principal thing is to walk before God, or under God's eye, aware that God is looking at you, searching your soul and your heart, seeing all that is there.

In <i>The Cracker Kitchen</i>, Janis Owens traces the root of the word <i>Cracker</i> back to its origins in Shakespeare's Elizabethan England -- when it meant braggart or big shot -- through its proliferation in America, where it became a derogatory term to describe poor and working-class Southerners. This compelling anthropological exploration peels back the historic misconceptions connected with the word to reveal a breed of proud, fiercely independent Americans with a deep love of their families, their country, their stories, and, most important, their food. <br> <br> With 150 recipes from over twenty different seasonal menus, <i>The Cracker Kitchen</i> offers a full year's worth of eating and rejoicing: from spring's Easter Dinner -- which includes recipes for Easter Ham, Green Bean Bundles, and, of course, Cracklin' Cornbread -- to summer's Fish Frys, fall's Tailgate Parties, and winter's In Celebration of Soul, honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. <br> <br> Recounted in Owens's delightful and hilarious voice, the family legends accompanying each of these menus leap off the page. We meet Uncle Kelly, the Prince of the Funny Funeral Story, who has family and friends howling with laughter at otherwise solemn occasions. We spend a morning with Janis and her friends at a Christmas Cookie Brunch as they bake delectable gifts for everyone on their holiday lists. And Janis's own father donates his famous fundamentalist biscuit recipe; truly a foretaste of glory divine. <br> <br> <i>The Cracker Kitchen</i> is a charming, irresistible celebration of family, storytelling, and good old-fashioned eating sure to appeal to anyone with an appreciation of Americana.</p><p><b>Janis Owens</b> is the author of three previous novels and a regional cookbook. The only daughter of a Pentecostal preacher turned insurance salesman, she inherited her love of storytelling from her parents. She lives in Newberry, Florida.<b> INTRODUCTION </b> <p> <b></b></p><b> Pat Conroy </b> <p> It was my great friend Doug Marlette who first brought me news of the amazing Florida novelist Janis Owens. He had met her at a book festival when he was publishing his first novel, <i>The Bridge</i>, and called to tell me he had found a new best friend for both of us. He was reading her first novel, <i>My Brother Michael</i>, and he didn't understand why Janis Owens wasn't famous.When I asked what was so great about her, Doug mentioned her pure authenticity, her comfortableness in her own skin, and her amazing gifts at storytelling. As Doug knew, I have a primordial attraction to the storytellers of the world. I ordered her three novels that night, and by the time I met Janis, I had read <i>My Brother Michael</i>, <i>Myra Sims</i>, and <i>The Schooling of Claybird Catts</i>. The three novels were an astonishment and a dilemma for me. She wrote about the hookwormed, xenophobic redneck South that has received such incessant ridicule in the literature of the South (including my own works) and in Hollywood movies that shiver with pleasure when their villains speak with those phony Southern accents. Janis used the term <i>Cracker</i> with affection and great understanding, and as I read her, I understood that she was awakening ghosts in my own kingdom that I would sooner or later have to interrogate if I was ever to understand the reign of both beauty and confusion in the life of my own mother, Peg Conroy.When I finished reading the three books, I called Doug Marlette and echoed his question: "Why isn't Janis Owens world famous?" </p><p> When I read her cookbook, it was a revelation. She would refer to herself and her family as Crackers and Rednecks with pride and affection and a great tenderness. If I had ever called my family or my cousins rednecks, I think it doubtful that my mother would have talked to me again. Though my mother hailed from an Alabama family whose Cracker credentials were in perfect order, she spent much of her energy and all of her life in denial of this unassailable fact. She became a brilliant historian of her own life, and almost nothing she said about herself was true. </p><p> After my mother read <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, and after her total immersion in the character of Scarlett O'Hara, my mother reinvented herself. The young girl who had previously answered to the name of Frances changed her middle name to Margaret and ordered her family to call her Peggy, after her new heroine Margaret "Peggy" Mitchell. I learned this story on the day we buried my mother in the Beaufort National Cemetery. It was the same day my grieving stepfather, Dr. John Egan, said between sobs that it was "such an honor to be married to a Southern aristocrat." My mother was an open-field runner against her past. Because I adored everything about her, I think I let her turn me into the same thing. </p><p> Janis Owens's cookbook is a love letter written to celebrate the poor white people of the American South who were my mother's people and my own. Since Janis is incapable of writing a bad sentence, her cookbook is a joy to read and a pleasure to return to again and again. She has produced a Cracker Escoffier, or a White-Trash Julia Child, that is hilarious and charming. Her tour of Southern food seems definitive to me. She does not gussy up any of her recipes for stylistic or culinary reasons. It makes you hungry just to flip through the pages of this high-spirited and userfriendly book. It also took me to long-forgotten memories of my past. </p><p> I've often written about my mother's failure as a Southern cook. As a housewife in the fifties, my mother discovered the labor-saving pleasures of frozen food. Even today, I cannot pass a frozen chicken-pot pie without becoming bulimic. My brother Mike has a freezer full of them and eats them with relish whenever he feels nostalgic for Mom. Frozen macaroni and cheese is an abomination unto the Lord to me.When I escaped my mother's kitchen and entered The Citadel, I discovered that I had never eaten spinach, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, and a whole produce department of other vegetables.Most cadets complained bitterly about the food in the mess hall, but I thought it was the finest food I had ever eaten, a cornucopia of guilty pleasures to discover and savor. </p><p> Yet, Janis's book caused me to remember some of the Southern dishes that my mother did well in the early years of her marriage. She could make perfect cornbread in a black skillet, and her fruit pies were legendary. Once a week, she composed a velvety lemon bisque that I could have inhaled with a straw. But it was in Piedmont, Alabama, and Orlando, Florida, that I feasted on the foods that Janis so lovingly describes in this cookbook. In Piedmont, my aunts and cousins would cook for hours preparing lunch for the men still in the fields. The meals were enormous, sensuous, and completely satisfying. Throughout the meal the women would burst out of the kitchen with some new steaming vegetable or fresh supply of biscuits. The gravies were heavenly, the fried chicken indescribable. Those were some of the happiest meals of my childhood. </p><p> In Orlando Aunt Helen and Uncle Russ would invite my family to the picnics at their Baptist church, and again, the recipes of Janis Owens were spread before my eyes in what seemed like endless profusion. When I asked my mother why Baptists ate so much better than Roman Catholics, she told me to shut up. I begged Aunt Helen to invite us to every church picnic that the Baptists organized, and if so, I promised not to fidget when she read from the Bible to my cousins, the Harper boys, each night. In Orlando I learned about congealed salads, aspics, deviled eggs, cole slaw, country ham, fried catfish, and dozens of other dishes that I had never encountered before.When we left Orlando, I thought that Baptists were the happiest, most well-fed people on earth. Later I'd tell my mother that I was thinking of becoming a Baptist so I would have lifetime access to those picnics, but Mother told me to hush up; if my father heard me, he'd kill me. I never brought up the subject again. </p><p> While reading several of the recipes in Cracker Kitchen, I burst out laughing because I'd never come across a recipe for roasted armadillo, rattlesnake, possum, or fried cooter. The world doesn't get any more Cracker than that, but I can't help but think that Janis is just showing out to make the outlander squeal. One of my favorite chapters is dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr. It is her chapter on soul food and its intimate connection to Cracker cooking. </p><p> Janis Owens writes, <i>"Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday falls on January 15, and I offer up this soul-inspired menu in his honor and for all the rest of the heroes of the Movement: John Lewis and Ralph Abernathy and every single Yank, Jew, Episcopal pacifist, and student agitator among them. When they put their lives on the line and agitated Jim Crow into oblivion, they freed not only the people of color but also the children of the oppressor, who inherited the gift of diversity and eventually learned a better way (or at least some of them did; I did). It's a favor that can't be forgotten and won't be; not if this Cracker has anything to do with it."</i> </p><p> When I came to those words, their heartfelt generosity stunned me.What a largesouled woman Janis Owens is! I never thought I would read such a stirring declaration in a book celebrating the Cracker nation. I wrote a cookbook in 2004 that I modestly called <i>The Pat Conroy Cookbook</i>. In it you can find recipes for Duck Pappardelle with Black Truffle Sauce, Saltimbocca alla Romana, Soup de Poisson, and...well, you get my drift. Like my mother, I've been running away from the South my whole life, and I'll have to do a lot of walking backwards to get home again. </p><p> Janis Owens's cookbook is unpretentious, yet it sugarcoats nothing about the Cracker culture she celebrates and loves. The book is pitch perfect in tone and execution. She tells of a hidden, mysterious Florida that few people know about, and in so doing has written the best cookbook based in central Florida since Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's <i>Cross Creek Cookery</i>. I wish my mother were alive so I could show her all the good times, and good food, that we missed. </p><p> Copyright ï¿½ 2009 by Janis Owens </p><p> <b></b></p><b> WELCOME TO MY KITCHEN </b> <p> Let me begin with a big country welcome to my kitchen.

If you&#x2019;d been there, in Nova Scotia&#x2014;they called it Acadia then&#x2014;in September of 1755, you would have seen the women down on their knees along the dirt lane, pleading, praying, wailing, reaching up with extended arms as their men and boys were marched from the church at Grand Prï¿½ down to the British ships that waited with the high tide.<br><br>All men and &#x201c;lads&#x201d; over the age of ten had been summoned to meet at the church at this Nova Scotian port town at exactly 3:00 p.m. on September 5. When 418 of the Acadians were gathered within the church, British soldiers barred the doors and windows. Colonel Winslow, the British commander, in a powdered wig, sat at a table surrounded by soldiers and read aloud from a document containing orders that supposedly originated with the king. It detailed the fate of these French-descended inhabitants of Nova Scotia&#x2014;the Acadians&#x2014;as the British soldiers went from port to port to round them up.<br><br>&#x201c;His instructions and commands, to wit, That your lands and tenements, cattle and live-stock of all kinds are forfeited to the Crown, together with all your other effects, except money and household goods, and that you yourselves are to be removed from this his province.&#x201d;<br><br>The decree was translated into French. The Acadians, most of them, didn&#x2019;t read or write. No one recorded their precise reaction at that moment in the church at Grand Prï¿½ more than two hundred years ago except as it lives on today in stories and songs among Acadian descendants in the bayous of Louisiana, deep in the North Woods of Maine, and still in parts of Nova Scotia. We have instead the words of Colonel Winslow himself, who wrote that the Acadians were &#x201c;greatly struck.&#x201d; He couldn&#x2019;t understand the imprecations hurled his way in their ancient dialect of French.<br><br>Inside the church at Grand Prï¿½, the British pointed their muskets at the outraged Acadian men and boys. The Acadian ancestors had migrated from France and settled here, on this great peninsula of land they called Acadia and we know as Nova Scotia that hovers out in the Atlantic east of Maine. By the time the British read their decree at Grand Prï¿½ in September 1755, the Acadians had lived on the peninsula for a century and a half. They&#x2019;d been among the very first permanent northern European migrants to the New World, arriving in 1606&#x2014;even before the first British colonists founded Jamestown far south in Virginia. The Acadians had hunted the forests for furs and for meat, fished the bays and coastlines, diked the tidal salt marshes into fields. Unlike many of the British settlers to the south, they&#x2019;d lived harmoniously with the Indians, learned to craft birch-bark canoes and snowshoes, traded with them, intermarried with them, raised mï¿½tis families. They &#x201c;trucked with the savages,&#x201d; as the British put it disgustedly. They were an independent, self-sufficient people, a people of the forests and the marshes and the rivers&#x2014;not quite French, not quite Indian, but both; or, rather, a unique people that blended both.<br><br>And now the end had come for Acadia. The British had won the great peninsula from France in 1710 in a military victory, and for more than forty years, during a time of peace between the two great empires, had let the Acadians be. But now war was again afoot between Britain and France. The Acadians, way out here on the remote fringes&#x2014;on the vague borderlands between the two clashing worlds&#x2014;were caught between.<br><br>The heavy rains started as we drove our rental car up the New England coast toward northern Maine&#x2014;toward the lands where fleeing Acadians had disappeared. After flying east from home in Montana, we&#x2019;d spent the night outside Boston, in Concord, close by Thoreau&#x2019;s Walden Pond. That morning, in the motel&#x2019;s breakfast room, where the children gleefully made waffles on the do-it-yourself iron, the television had predicted rain for the next four to five days. As I paid the bill in the lobby, a fine, warm Gulf Stream drizzle was falling on the electric-green motel lawn. A few hours later on I-95, when our economy rental car reached L.L.Bean at Freeport, Maine, a blurry deluge crashed on the windshield and streamed up from the tires. At Bean&#x2019;s, I bought a tarp, poles to suspend it, extra tent stakes, and a new rain jacket to replace my old one, as it suddenly seemed woefully inadequate. As a kind of treat to myself, I also bought a new fly rod. For the children, already well outfitted with rain jackets and pants, Amy picked up a couple of extra insect headnets&#x2014;the kind with brims. The previous night, over an expensive bistro dinner in Concord, she&#x2019;d been much bemused by conjuring the image of me taking notes while wearing a headnet propped up on sticks.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s blank where we&#x2019;re going,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d choked through tears of laughter over her soup, to the children&#x2019;s bewilderment. &#x201c;No one wants to live there! Because of the bugs!&#x201d;<br><br>But it was the prospect of rain that bothered me more than the threat of bugs. I was slightly cheered after we left the coast past Bean&#x2019;s, heading inland, almost due north, on I-95, and the rain tapered off. By the time we reached Medway&#x2014;the gateway to the Maine Woods, a couple of hours inland&#x2014;the rain had stopped altogether. Stuffed to the ceiling with our camping gear, our little white car bumped off the dry highway and into the graveled parking lot of Nicatou Outfitters, a wood-sided building scattered with a few others beside the road. The late afternoon gloom and heavy gray skies held low over the pointy tips of the dense fir and spruce forest behind the shop. I was thinking, Five days. That&#x2019;s a whole lot of rain on an eight-day canoe trip. Especially on a wilderness river. With children. And no way out of the forest. Except paddling onward into the cold downpour.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you Betsy?&#x201d; I asked the wiry, blondish, thirty-something woman who emerged from the shop to greet us, followed by a bouncy young black Lab.<br><br>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>I later would learn that her mother&#x2019;s family, the Faloons, had settled here in the mid-1800s when Medway was still known as Nicatou&#x2014;located at the forks of the East and West Branches of the Penobscot River. Her husband, Galen Hale, held a regular job with the Maine environmental inspection branch while she ran their outfitting shop. Inside, fishing lures and billed hats and paddling gear lined the walls, and a wide assortment of mosquito repellent. I inspected the varieties while she gamely showed our children, Molly, eleven, and Skyler, eight, how the black Lab, Nicky, could roll over.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been so wet lately. I was out in my garden today and the bugs were pretty bad. You&#x2019;ll want to bring plenty of bug dope,&#x201d; she said, in an accent full of dropped &#x201c;r&#x201d;s and open &#x201c;a&#x201d;s.<br><br>I&#x2019;d heard the same mantra&#x2014;&#x201c;bring plenty of bug dope&#x201d;&#x2014;from at least three other Mainers, including her husband, Galen. From Montana, I&#x2019;d spoken to him by phone several times, telling him I was looking for the emptiest, blankest spots on the map, as well as an outfitter to help us.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know the Saint John River?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d asked him.<br><br>&#x201c;Ayup,&#x201d; he replied, with that famous Mainer laconic brevity.<br><br>Could he rent us canoes for it?<br><br>Ayup.<br><br>Could he guide us down it if we wanted?<br><br>Ayup.<br><br>Did he know the other rivers of northern Maine?<br><br>Ayup.<br><br>Then, in a burst of loquaciousness, he volunteered his qualifications.<br><br>&#x201c;I been living here in Medway all my life. My family started guiding here in 1833. When Henry Thoreau came to the Maine Woods in 1846, his guide was Thomas Fowler. That&#x2019;s my great-great-great-granduncle by marriage, on my mother&#x2019;s side. I can show you pretty much exactly where Thoreau went, if you want. I can even show you where he spent the night here in Medway. Supposedly at Mom Howard&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew I&#x2019;d found my man. You could say that in a strange, roundabout way it was Galen Hale&#x2019;s great-great-great-granduncle by marriage (on his mother&#x2019;s side) who inspired me&#x2014;and other like-minded Americans&#x2014;to have a passion for wild places to begin with, to yearn for the blank spots remaining on the map. Until Thoreau and company came along in the early 1800s, most of what European people strove for during their first three hundred years on the American continent was to stamp out every spot of blankness that they could reach. They sought out these blank places, this largely uncultivated continent thinly peopled by Indians, as cheap land to homestead. They saw nothing good&#x2014;but rather evil&#x2014;in the &#x201c;wildness&#x201d; of it. The value of blank spots, of wild places, lay only in their cultivation&#x2014;in &#x201c;civilizing&#x201d; these spots and &#x201c;taming&#x201d; the natives. It was in good part Thoreau&#x2014;and his trips to the Maine Woods&#x2014;who changed all that.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a brave woman, Amy,&#x201d; remarked David Skipper as another gust of rain lashed the windshield of his van.<br>A burly, friendly man, Skipper drove shuttles to the Maine rivers for Galen and Betsy Hale&#x2019;s clients who wished to canoe. He now steered the big blue van&#x2014;our rented canoes lashed on top, our mound of gear loaded in back&#x2014;down a gloomy mud-and-gravel forest road. The wipers whipped back and forth. The rains had begun that morning, reaching from the coast up into the Maine Woods, when we woke up in the little motel across from the Hales&#x2019; shop in Medway. For nearly three hours since Medway, we&#x2019;d been driving on these graveled roads through the soaking wet fir and spruce woods, through this great green sponge of evergreen trees, woody brush, dripping moss.<br><br>&#x201c;How much longer?&#x201d; Skyler finally asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Five minutes,&#x201d; Skipper said.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later the gravel road curved right, and we barreled off it down into a low, grassy clearing with a small campground that opened onto the shore of a large gray lake.<br><br>Gauzy gusts of rain blew across its surface, veiling and unveiling the low, darker gray bands of pointed spruce and fir that ringed the far shore. I spotted one other human presence in the campground, the first we&#x2019;d seen for the last hour or so of driving&#x2014;a pickup truck and camping trailer at the clearing&#x2019;s far end, buttoned up tight against the weather. It was early June, but the gloom made it feel like late November.<br><br>This was Baker Lake, and we were at its foot. Its outlet stream ran past the campground, about fifty or sixty feet wide, sliding past us before disappearing between the walls of forest. Here lay the headwaters of the St. John River. The village of Allagash, the first settlement downstream from this spot, sat a hundred miles away. Those hundred miles we&#x2019;d paddle by canoe.<br><br>We climbed out of the van into the downpour. Amy scrambled to help Skyler and Molly pull on rain pants, rain jackets, and rain hoods while David and I unstrapped the canoes and laid them on the wet gravel landing at the river&#x2019;s edge. As quickly as I could, I nestled our ten or twelve waterproof dry sacks containing sleeping bags, clothes, tent, and two large coolers crammed with food into the canoe hulls. It was already three o&#x2019;clock, and I was eager to make some distance before dark.<br><br>Back in the Nicatou Outfitters shop at Medway that morning, Galen and David had mentioned that, along the right riverbank a few hours downstream from Baker Lake, sat an old trapper&#x2019;s cabin.<br><br>&#x201c;Remember that cabin,&#x201d; David now reminded us. &#x201c;That would be a mighty nice place to spend the night in weather like<br>this. It&#x2019;s there for anybody who wants to use it.&#x201d;<br><br>Skyler abandoned his hunt for arrowheads along the shore and we climbed in&#x2014;Skyler in the bow of one canoe and I in the stern, Molly in the bow of the other and Amy in the stern. David helped shove us out into the river.<br><br>We four raised our paddles, swiveled the canoes to point downstream, and began stroking into the gusts of a stiff headwind, waving goodbye to David as we slipped into the rainy, gray-green forest.<br><br>Acadia, one might say, was born of indifference by rival empires, and was finally killed off by the same imperial rivalries.<br><br>In 1541, Spanish spies, skulking around French ports, got wind of a French expedition, under Jacques Cartier, headed to North America to establish France&#x2019;s claims to regions around the St. Lawrence, which Cartier had explored a few years earlier. Spain, of course, decades before in the wake of Columbus, had established American colonies farther south&#x2014;in Mexico and then South America. After catching wind of Cartier&#x2019;s expedition for French settlements in the New World, the Spaniards consulted with the Portuguese, who also had their own American colonies, in Brazil. Should they should take action against the French plans for settlement near the St. Lawrence?<br><br>&#x201c;They can do no harm at Baccalaos,&#x201d; the Portuguese diplomats soothed the upset Spaniards.<br><br>Baccalaos was the Spanish and Portuguese name for the northern region. It meant &#x201c;Codland&#x201d;&#x2014;the rich shoals of fish on the Grand Banks, the continental shelf off today&#x2019;s Newfoundland. Since the early 1500s, the Grand Banks had drawn an annual fishing fleet of Basque, Portuguese, and Breton vessels that stuffed their holds with salted codfish and sold them in Europe (Portuguese recipes today still call for the salted cod known as bacalhau). But, thick as these cold, foggy regions were with schools of offshore cod, the Spanish and Portuguese apparently didn&#x2019;t think it worth fighting the French over settlement claims to them. The wealth of cod lay offshore, for one thing, and, besides, the Spanish and Portuguese claimed far greater empires&#x2014;rich with gold and silver&#x2014;in the lands to the south.<br><br>Initially, they proved to be right. It wasn&#x2019;t worth fighting for. After suffering a terrible winter from scurvy and cold along the St. Lawrence, Cartier returned to France the next summer commanding what turned out to be a boatload of quartz &#x201c;diamonds&#x201d; and fool&#x2019;s gold. As an explorer, Cartier was put out to pasture in a crude manor house near St.-Malo, while for the next fifty years, throughout the late 1500s, the French mostly ignored their claims to North America as they fought decades of civil war between the Catholics and the Protestant Huguenots. When the religious wars ended, however, eyes again turned to the New World.</p><h2>Shot Through Velvet: A Crime of Fashion Mystery</h2><p>Fashion reporter Lacey Smithsonian is touring a failing velvet factory in Virginia on its final day of operations-and finds one of the factory owners dead, lashed to a spool of velvet and soaked in blue dye. The workers are delighted, since they blamed the "Blue Devil" for killing their jobs. <br><br> But when another nickname, the "Velvet Avenger", makes the rounds, and ribbons of blue velvet start popping up, it could be more than Lacey's job at stake-it could be her life...</p><p>Ellen Byerrum is a journalist in Washington, D.C., and a produced and published playwright. She holds a Virginia private investigator&#x2019;s registration. A Colorado native, she lives in Virginia with her husband. Visit her Web site at www.ellenbyerrum.com.Starred Review. Blue velvet takes on a shocking shade of death in Byerrum's first-rate seventh Crime of Fashion mystery starring Washington, D.C., fashion reporter Lacey Smithsonian (after 2008's Armed and Glamorous). Lacey's boyfriend, Vic Donovan, a security expert (and former Sagebrush, Colo., police chief), accompanies Lacey to interview Rod Gibbs (aka Blue Devil), the hated company spokesperson and part owner of Dominion Velvet, a newly closed velvet factory in Black Martin, Va. When Rod turns up dead and stained midnight blue in a dye vat after having been hit on the head and shot, no one, neither employees nor Rod's estranged wife, mourns his demise. Complications ensue after Lacey learns that Claudia Darnell, her publisher, is a Dominion Velvet silent partner, along with politician Tazewell Flanders. A serious look at the decline of the U.S. textile and newspaper industries provides much food for thought. (Feb.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

A manhunt ensues&#x2014;though the authorities aren&#x2019;t sure if it&#x2019;s a man they should be looking for. <br><br>Some suspect an escapee from the White Tower, a foreboding biotech facility owned by the Godfrey family&#x2014;their personal fortune and the local economy having moved on from Pittsburgh steel&#x2014;where,&nbsp;if rumors are true,&nbsp;biological experiments of the most unethical kind take place. Others turn to Peter Rumancek, a Gypsy trailer-trash kid who has told impressionable high school classmates that he&#x2019;s a werewolf. Or perhaps it&#x2019;s Roman, the son of the late JR Godfrey, who rules the adolescent social scene with the casual arrogance of a cold-blooded aristocrat, his superior status unquestioned despite his decidedly freakish sister, Shelley, whose monstrous medical conditions belie a sweet intelligence, and his otherworldly control freak of a mother, Olivia. &nbsp;At once a riveting mystery and a fascinating revelation of the grotesque and the darkness in us all, <i>Hemlock Grove</i> has the architecture and energy to become a classic in its own right&#x2014;and Brian McGreevy the talent and ambition to enthrall us for years to come.</p><p>Brian McGreevy grew up near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and received his MFA from the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas.

But why does the pack howl when no wolf is lost?<br>Isn&#x2019;t it obvious?<br>Because there is no other way to say it.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The night after the Harvest Moon, the body was discovered. It was nearing October and the sun was still hot, but the leaves were falling now with intention and every night was colder. Peter was walking home from the bus stop when he saw the flashing light of a fire truck up at Kilderry Park. He wondered if there had been an accident. Peter, who was seventeen at the time of which I&#x2019;m writing, liked accidents: modern times were just so fucking structured. He saw in addition to the fire truck a few cop cars and an ambulance, but no signs of wreckage. He turned his head in passing, but there was nothing more to see beyond the norm. Two of the cops combing the area by the swings he knew; they&#x2019;d hassled him a couple of times in that kind of obligatory cop way that, in Peter&#x2019;s experience, every uniform was an SS uniform. Probably some junkie had OD&#x2019;d or something. There was that bum who hung out around here, an old black guy with yellow and black teeth and one dead eye that looked like a dirty marble who might not have been old, really. Peter had given him a light once, but no change. Better that paid for his own drugs. His interest flagged. Old black junkie kicks it it&#x2019;s no more news than chance of rain tomorrow. Then he heard it, one sentence. <i>No sign of a weapon, Sheriff.</i> Peter looked again but there was no more to see than a milling cluster of uniforms by the tree line and he put his hands in his pockets and went on.<br>He had a bad feeling.<br>Nicolae had always told him that he had been born with an unusually receptive Swadisthana chakra and that underneath the surfaces of things, the illusion of the illusion, there is a secret, sacred frequency of the universe and that the Swadisthana was the channel through which it would sing to you. And the Swadisthana being located of course just behind the balls, he should always always trust his balls. Peter did not know what it was, but something about the scene in Kilderry Park had his balls in a state of agitation.<br>When he got home he told his mother, &#x201c;Something happened.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d; she said. She was smoking a joint and watching a quiz show. The trailer was warm and smelled sweet, pot and baked apple. &#x201c;Hummingbird!&#x201d; she yelled suddenly, in response to the question <i>What is the only bird that can fly backwards.</i><br>He told her what he saw. He told her he had a bad feeling.<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, I just do,&#x201d; he said.<br>She was thoughtful. &#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s cobbler,&#x201d; she said.<br>He went to the kitchen. She asked if he&#x2019;d been in town.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said.<br>She emptied his backpack of items so small and modest it could hardly be considered stealing while Peter scraped the tar of sugar at the edge of the cobbler and tried to shake this feeling. The feeling that whatever had happened in Kilderry Park was no good. And not in some greater existential sense but no good with his number on it. There was a coffee mug on the counter with the comic strip character Cathy on it and a small chip the shape of a shark&#x2019;s tooth that held loose change. He dipped his hand in the mug and went to the door and scattered a handful of coins on the stone path out front.<br>&#x201c;Why did you do that?&#x201d; said Lynda.<br>Peter shrugged. He had done it because he wanted to hear something dissonant and beautiful.<br>&#x201c;You are one strange customer, you know that?&#x201d; said Lynda.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Peter.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright ï¿½ 2012 by Brian McGreevy<br></p><h2>The Great Debate (The Days of Laura Ingalls Wilder, 7)</h2><p>The Great Debate (The Days of Laura Ingalls Wilder, 7)</p><p></p><h2>Between Parent and Teenager</h2><p>Presents parents with advice on the handling of everyday difficulties and serious crises which arise in the parent-teenager relationship</p><p></p><h2>With Love from a Country Kitchen: Homegrown Memories and Recipes</h2><p><p>Let the smell of freshly baked apple pie and the familiar sounds of a busy cook bustling about the kitchen fill you with warm memories of a simpler life as you enjoy Deb Strain's paintings of classic American scenes.

Bush. Yet beneath the surface events of the Bush presidency lies a secret history -- a series of hidden events that makes a mockery of current debate. <br> <br> This hidden history involves domestic spying, abuses of power, and outrageous operations. It includes a CIA that became caught in a political cross fire that it could not withstand, and what it did to respond. It includes a Defense Department that made its own foreign policy, even against the wishes of the commander in chief. It features a president who created a sphere of deniability in which his top aides were briefed on matters of the utmost sensitivity -- but the president was carefully kept in ignorance. <i>State of War</i> reveals this hidden history for the first time, including scandals that will redefine the Bush presidency. <br> <br> James Risen has covered national security for <i>The New York Times</i> for years. Based on extraordinary sources from top to bottom in Washington and around the world, drawn from dozens of interviews with key figures in the national security community, this book exposes an explosive chain of events: <br> <ul> <li>Contrary to law, and with little oversight, the National Security Administration has been engaged in a massive domestic spying program.</li> <li>On such sensitive issues as the use of torture, the administration created a zone of deniability: the president's top advisors were briefed, but the president himself was not.</li> <li>The United States actually gave nuclear-bomb designs to Iran.</li> <li>The CIA had overwhelming evidence that Iraq had no nuclear weapons programs during the run-up to the Iraq war. They kept that information to themselves and didn't tell the president.</li> <li>While the United States has refused to lift a finger, Afghanistan has become a narco-state, supplying 87 percent of the heroin sold on the global market.</li> </ul> <br> These are just a few of the stories told in <i>State of War. </i>Beyond these shocking specifics, Risen describes troubling patterns: Truth-seekers within the CIA were fired or ignored. Long-standing rules were trampled. Assassination squads were trained; war crimes were proposed. Yet for all the aggressiveness of America's spies, a blind eye was turned toward crucial links between al Qaeda and Saudi Arabia, among other sensitive topics. <br> <br> Not since the revelations of CIA and FBI abuses in the 1970s have so many scandals in the intelligence community come to light. More broadly, Risen's secret history shows how power really works in George W. Bush's presidency.</p><p>The winter holidays are usually a quiet time for news, but the December 2005 revelations of the Bush administration's extensive, off-the-books domestic spying program by <i>New York Times</i> reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau made headline after headline, raising criticism from both sides of the aisle and an immediate, unapologetic response from President Bush himself. On the heels of those scoops comes Risen's <i>State of War</i>, which goes beyond his <i>Times</i> stories to provide a wide-ranging, if anecdotal, "secret history" of U.S. intelligence following 9/11. <p> Risen's description of what he says was called "the Program"--the ongoing eavesdropping operation, done with almost no judicial or congressional oversight, on the phone calls and emails of hundreds of Americans (and potentially millions more)--is only a chapter in his larger tale of the recent missteps and oversteps of U.S. intelligence. His evidence ranges from insider White House accounts of Donald Rumsfeld, "the ultimate turf warrior," outmaneuvering his rivals to make the Defense Department the dominant voice in foreign policy, to on-the-ground reports of the administration's willful ignorance of crucial intelligence on the dormancy of Saddam's weapons programs, Saudi support for al Qaeda, and the startlingly rapid transformation of Afghanistan into a "narco-state" under American authority. Some of the episodes he recounts--Saudi security officials with Osama bin Laden screensavers, an Iraqi scientist who had told the CIA his country had no nuclear program watching Colin Powell testify to the UN that they did--would be comical were the stakes less high. </p><p> Risen's loyalties are not with the opposition party--he's sharply critical of Clinton's disinterest in the CIA--but with the career field agents who are his best sources. Those agents and their expertise, he argues, have been cast aside, along with the long centrist tradition of U.S. foreign policy and the basic checks and balances of the American system of government, by the Bush administration's radical politicization and militarization of intelligence. He covers a lot of ground in a book of just over 200 pages, some of it familiar from other accounts, and at times his tradecraft anecdotes can be hard to assess without context. But his specific revelations and his well-sourced, angry overview of the way the battles against terror have been fought make for startling, newsmaking reading. <i>--Tom Nissley</i></p><b>James Risen</b> covers national security for<i> The New York Times. </i>He was a member of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting in 2002 for coverage of September 11 and terrorism, and he is the coauthor of <i>Wrath of Angels</i> and <i>The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB. </i>He lives outside Washington, D.C., with his wife and three sons.</p><h2>Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet Bolivia</i></b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

By the author of the &#34;Fear Street&#34; series. Original.</p><p>"Where do you get your ideas?" <p> That's the question that <b>R. L. Stine</b> is asked most often. "I don't know where my ideas come from," he says. "But I do know that I have a lot more scary stories in my mind that I can't wait to write." </p><p> So far, he has written nearly three dozen mysteries and thrillers for young people, all of them best-sellers. </p><p> Bob grew up in Columbus, Ohio. Today he lives in an apartment near Central Park in New York City with his wife, Jane, and fourteen-year-old son, Matt.</p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> I shut my eyes as a shrill scream escaped my throat. </p><p> Bouncing hard, I opened them in time to see the trees fly by in a jarring blur. "Whoa!" I was tossed forward as I roared straight down into darkness. </p><p> A sudden spin made me cry out again. The car tilted hard to the left and I slammed into my cousin, Ashley Franks. She was screaming, too. Her blond hair flew out wildly behind her head. </p><p> We swooped down once more, a sharp dip. I yelped in surprise as I felt myself fly up from the seat. The trees whirred by, shadowy in the dark night light. The car clattered noisily as it began to climb again. </p><p> "This is <i>great!</i>" I screamed to Ashley. </p><p> Her face was bright red. Her blue eyes were wide, staring up to the top of the track. She grinned at me and started to reply. But instead, she let out a startled <i>whoop</i> as our car plunged down. </p><p> Down, down with a deafening roar. </p><p> The wind battered my face. I gripped the bar tightly with both hands. Down, down -- and into total darkness. </p><p> "Huh?" </p><p> A tunnel. We whirred through the tunnel, then back out into the dim light filtering through the dark, leafy trees. Then a jolting turn pushed me into Ashley again. My cousin was screaming too hard to notice. </p><p> Another tunnel. Another climb. Another swooping, roaring spin that made the car squeal. </p><p> And then we slowed to a stop. </p><p> Over my thudding heartbeat I could hear screams and laughter behind us. Ashley and I had been riding in the front car. </p><p> I turned to her. She was still breathing hard. Her hair was wild, standing almost straight up. She was trying to brush it down with both hands. </p><p> "You were right, James!" she exclaimed. "The Beastï¿½ is <i>awesome!</i>" </p><p> "It's the best! I told you!" I cried breathlessly. I climbed out of the roller coaster car onto the platform. "Hey -- I'm dizzy!" </p><p> "You're always dizzy," Ashley teased, following me out. She staggered for a few steps, then grabbed my shoulder. She laughed. "Whoa! I'm a little dizzy, too, I guess." </p><p> We staggered off the platform and followed the exit path. I turned back to stare at the enormous roller coaster, the wooden tracks rising up darker even than the night sky. </p><p> My heart was still racing. As Ashley and I walked, we were surrounded by laughing, shouting voices. "I -- I thought the ride was over," Ashley said, still trying to untangle her hair. "But then we started to climb again." </p><p> "That has to be the longest roller coaster ride anywhere!" I exclaimed. "Other roller coasters last only a minute or two. But this one takes over four minutes!" </p><p> I'm an expert on roller coasters. I ride them whenever I can. And I never ride just once. I always go back and ride again and again. </p><p> The third time is usually the best. By that time, your screaming muscles are limbered up and you can howl like a pro all the way. </p><p> I'd been to Paramount's Kings Island twice before. And I had ridden The Beast at least half a dozen times. But this was Ashley's first time. </p><p> She's twelve and I'm twelve, but I think I look older. She's about four inches shorter than me, even with all that wild blond hair. She's skinny, too. I guess she's kind of pretty. She has great blue eyes and a nice smile. </p><p> People always tease me because I don't smile much. I've got dark brown hair and dark eyes, and I just look serious, that's all. </p><p> Ashley and I don't get to see each other very often. Our families live about three hundred miles apart. But when we do, we get along pretty well. </p><p> We like to tease each other and get on each other's case. Sometimes we play pretty mean tricks on each other. But I guess that's normal. </p><p> We stopped at a food stand and bought sodas. All that screaming can make you thirsty. </p><p> After gulping down half her cup of soda, Ashley glanced up at the dark sky. A pale halfmoon had risen above the trees. "It's getting pretty late," she said. "Past your bedtime, James." </p><p> "Ha-ha," I replied, rolling my eyes. </p><p> She took another long gulp from her cup. Some of it trickled onto the front of her sleeveless blue T-shirt, but she didn't notice. She pushed her hair off her forehead with her free hand. </p><p> "What do you want to do now?" I asked. We had been at the park since early afternoon. We had already been on most of the other roller coasters. </p><p> "Let's ride The Beast again!" Ashley cried. Her eyes lit up as an excited grin crossed her face. "Come on!" </p><p> "The line is pretty long," I told her, motioning to it. I glanced at my watch. "And the park is going to close soon." </p><p> "Come on!" she cried, not listening to me. She tugged at the sleeve of my T-shirt. "Hurry!" </p><p> I pulled back. "No. Really. There isn't time, Ashley," I insisted. </p><p> "Please! Let's just try -- okay?" she begged, tugging at me again. "Let's get in line again. Please?" </p><p> "Well...okay," I agreed. </p><p> And that was when all the trouble began. </p><p> </p><p>Copyright ï¿½ 1994 Parachute Press, Inc. </p></p><h2>The compleat brown trout (Angling heritage book)</h2><p>First Edition, printed in 1976 by Winchester Press. hardcover with dust jacket.</p><p></p><h2>Jackdaws (Random House Large Print)</h2><p>D-Day is approaching. They don&#x2019;t know where or when, but the Germans know it&#x2019;ll be soon, and for Felicity &#x201c;Flick&#x201d; Clariet, the stakes have never been higher. A senior agent in the ranks of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) responsible for sabotage, Flick has survived to become one of Britain&#x2019;s most effective operatives in Northern France. She knows that the Germans&#x2019; ability to thwart the Allied attack depends upon their lines of communications, and in the days before the invasion no target is of greater strategic importance than the largest telephone exchange in Europe.<br><br>But when Flick and her Resistance-leader husband try a direct, head-on assault that goes horribly wrong, her world turns upside down. Her group destroyed, her husband missing, her superiors unsure of her, her own confidence badly shaken, she has one last chance at the target, but the challenge, once daunting, is now near impossible. The new plan requires an all-woman team, none of them professionals, to be assembled and trained within days. Code-named the Jackdaws, they will attempt to infiltrate the exchange under the noses of the Germans-but the Germans are waiting for them now and have plans of their own. There are secrets Flick does not know-secrets within the German ranks, secrets among her hastily recruited team, secrets among those she trusts the most. And as the hours tick down to the point of no return, most daunting of all, there are secrets within herself...<br><br>Filled with the powerful storytelling, unforgettable characters, and authentic detail that have become his hallmarks, Jackdaws is Ken Follett writing at the height of his powers.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, November 2001:</b> Each book by Ken Follett, one of the most successful suspense writers of our time, is a welcome event. With <i>Jackdaws</i>, he returns to his most successful era, the darkest days of World War II.<p> It is 1944 and the Allies are preparing for the invasion of Europe. In the occupied town of Sainte-Cecile, the French Resistance is preparing to blow up the chateau that now houses the crucial telephone exchange connecting the French telephone system to that of Germany. Bombers have been unable to inflict enough damage on the chateau to disrupt communications for more than a few hours at a time, but the Allies need to make sure that communications is down for longer so that there will be as little warning of the invasion as possible.</p><p> Felicity Clariet, known as Flick, is a British secret agent patrolling the streets around the chateau waiting for the first explosions that will give the signal for the attack to begin. She is married to Michel, a Resistance fighter. When the operation goes horribly wrong, they barely escape with their lives and Flick returns to her home in London--but not for long. When Flick returns to France it will be as part of an audacious, quickly assembled plan to put female spies in the chateau as telephone operators and cleaners, enabling the Allies to destroy the ability of the Exchange to warn Germany in advance of the landing on the beaches of Normandy. The twists and turns of the plot will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p><p> Follett tells us that <i>Jackdaws</i> is based on a true story.

Best-known for his deadpan still-life paintings of cakes, pies, delicatessen counters, and other consumer goods, Thiebaud has also explored such themes as figure studies, the topography of Northern California, and cityscapes exaggerating the vertiginous roadways and geometric high-rises of San Francisco. Continuous throughout his career is his combination of the perceptual and the conceptual, of sensuous color, light, and painterly texture with rigorously formal composition, resulting in a highly personalized Americana. <em>Wayne Thiebaud: A Paintings Retrospective</em> is published on the occasion of an exhibition of the same title, the first major survey in fifteen years of work by this famous American figurative artist. Steven A. Nash, Associate Director and Chief Curator at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, has organized the exhibition and provides a biographical essay on Thiebaud. An extended essay by Adam Gopnik, the Paris Journal writer for <em>The New Yorker</em>, links Thiebaud to American writing as a painter in the tradition of Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams, and John Updike.</p><p>Famous for his dreamy 1960s paintings of cakes, Wayne Thiebaud began his career as a commercial artist and cartoon illustrator like many other artists of the period, including Andy Warhol. And like Warhol, Thiebaud became tied to pop art since he was making images of popular American products like food, lipsticks, and toys. Yet unlike many of his pop peers, Bay Area-based Thiebaud wasn't interested in poking fun at the establishment. He's a painter's painter, a real traditionalist. <i>Wayne Thiebaud: A Paintings Retrospective</i> covers a career of rendering still lifes, cityscapes, landscapes, and the figure. His cake paintings are formally beautiful in their color, shadow, and composition. They are perfect specimens of the good life in America, the paint lovingly applied in places like thick frosting. His cityscapes of San Francisco fiercely exaggerate the hilly landscape, capturing a perspective from the ground and air simultaneously while utilizing the light that the Bay Area is famous for. <p> Thoughtful essays by Steven A. Nash, associate director and chief curator for the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, and Adam Gopnik, a writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, discuss Thiebaud in relation to his peers, pop, modernism, and abstract expressionism. This book serves as a catalog for Thiebaud's major retrospective, which opened in San Francisco and travels to Forth Worth, Texas, Washington, D.C., and ends in New York in the fall of 2001. Besides their beauty, these works truly capture a period of American life in a way that feels free of irony but not without commentary about nature, the city, and how we've lived. <i>--J.P.

Daisy Goodwin breathes new life into Victoria's story, and does so with sensitivity, verve, and wit."</b><br> <b>&#x2013; AMANDA FOREMAN</b></p><p>Drawing on Queen Victoria&#x2019;s diaries, which she first started reading when she was a student at Cambridge University, Daisy Goodwin&#x2015;creator and writer of the new PBS Masterpiece drama <i>Victoria</i> and author of the bestselling novels <i>The American Heiress</i> and <i>The Fortune Hunter&#x2015;</i>brings the young nineteenth-century monarch, who would go on to reign for 63 years, richly to life in this magnificent novel.</p><p>Early one morning, less than a month after her eighteenth birthday, Alexandrina Victoria is roused from bed with the news that her uncle William IV has died and she is now Queen of England. The men who run the country have doubts about whether this sheltered young woman, who stands less than five feet tall, can rule the greatest nation in the world. </p><p>Despite her age, however, the young queen is no puppet. She has very definite ideas about the kind of queen she wants to be, and the first thing is to choose her name.</p><p>&#x201c;I do not like the name Alexandrina,&#x201d; she proclaims. &#x201c;From now on I wish to be known only by my second name, Victoria.&#x201d;</p><p>Next, people say she must choose a husband. Everyone keeps telling her she&#x2019;s destined to marry her first cousin, Prince Albert, but Victoria found him dull and priggish when they met three years ago. She is quite happy being queen with the help of her prime minister, Lord Melbourne, who may be old enough to be her father but is the first person to take her seriously. </p><p>On June 19th, 1837, she was a teenager. On June 20th, 1837, she was a queen. Daisy Goodwin&#x2019;s impeccably researched and vividly imagined new book brings readers Queen Victoria as they have never seen her before.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2016:</strong> For a monarch, there's perhaps no greater historical compliment than to have a time period named after you. Daisy Goodwin, author of <em>The American Heiress</em>, spotlights Victoria's earliest moments on the throne, from the days before her coronation, to her first clash with Parliament and the venerable Lord Wellington, and finally the moment when she proposes to her cousin, Prince Albert. As the 18-year-old queen assumes her regal duties, Victoria discovers the limitations of her governmental powers even as she spreads her wings as a woman who has escaped out from under her mother's thumb and can finally rule herself. There are dramatic missteps along the way, and more than once the reader may find Victoria unsympathetic. However, Goodwin does a deft job in her novelization of Victoria's first two years as monarch, exploring the emotional challenges for a young, sheltered woman who now sits on the throne of a powerful country. Some personages are little more than cardboard, but those who matter in this narrative&#x2014;Lord Melbourne, Prince Albert, and Victoria herself&#x2014;are penned with more detail, revealing an appealing and vulnerable side to a queen later viewed as nigh unassailable. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em>DAISY GOODWIN is the author of the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling novels <i>The American Heiress </i>and<i> The Fortune Hunter. </i>She is a Harkness Scholar who attended Columbia University's film school after earning a degree in history at Cambridge University, and was Chair of the judging panel of the 2010 Orange Prize for Fiction.
